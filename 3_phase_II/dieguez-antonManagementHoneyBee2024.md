# Quantitative Data: Diéguez-Antón et al. 2024

## Template-Relevant Data

### Study Design
- **Type**: Review/Recommendations article
- **Focus**: Management of honey bee colonies under V. velutina pressure
- **Geographic scope**: Europe (primarily Galicia, Spain and Portugal)

### Colony Losses
- **Reported losses**: 30-80% (European beekeepers)
- **Honey production**: Reduction reported
- **Indirect costs**: 10% increase in beekeeping costs

### Life Cycle Data
- **Queen lifespan**: ~1 year (from emergence in autumn to death following autumn)
- **Queen length**: Up to 3.5 cm
- **Male length**: Usually ~3 cm
- **Worker length**: 1.7-2.5 cm (smaller in primary nests)
- **Colony size (maximum)**: >30,000 individuals (well-established areas)
- **Nest size (maximum)**: >1 m in height
- **Life cycle start**: End of January/beginning of February (favorable conditions) or March (less favorable, higher latitudes)

### Predation Period
- **Start**: As early as April (depending on weather and latitude)
- **Peak months**: July, August, September, October
- **Duration**: Can last until winter in some areas (Galicia, Portugal)

### Control Methods Specifications
- **Entrance reducers**: 5-6 mm gaps
- **Queen excluders**: 4.3 mm gaps
- **Muzzle mesh**: 6 × 6 mm
- **Muzzle distance**: >25 cm from entrance
- **Electric harp wire spacing**: Allows bees to pass, hornets touch 2 wires
- **Harp placement**: Between every 2 or 3 hives

### Food Requirements
- **Minimum colony weight (autumn)**: 20 kg (excluding wooden materials)
- **Minimum population**: 4,000-5,000 bees

## Other Quantitative Data

### Nest Characteristics
- **Embryo nests**: Small, fragile, single comb, few cells
- **Primary nests**: Size of a football
- **Secondary nests**: Can exceed 1 m height
- **Relocation**: Common when primary nest cannot be enlarged

### Caste Abundance
- **Workers**: Present throughout most of cycle
- **Males**: Emerge early September (~15 days before gynes)
- **Gynes**: Emerge after males
- **Peak reproductives**: November

### Management Recommendations
- **Varroa treatment timing**: After honey harvest
- **Food supplementation**: Essential when foraging stopped
- **Colony strength**: Key to survival
- **Monitoring frequency**: Regular checks recommended

### Seasonal Management
- **Spring**: Check colonies, Varroa treatment if needed, monitor for hornets
- **Summer**: Maintain strong colonies, harvest before peak pressure, install protection methods
- **Autumn**: Check food reserves, feed if needed, treat Varroa if brood reduced
- **Winter**: Feed with solid food, deactivate harps, remove muzzles and traps

### Trap Specifications
- **Attractant**: Sugary component + alcoholic liquid
- **Selectivity**: V. velutina represents ~1% of trapped insects
- **Placement**: Close to previous nest sites (for foundress trapping)

### Health Indicators
- **External indicators**: Number of hornets at entrance, presence/absence of bees, hornets entering hive
- **Internal indicators**: Varroa presence, population size, brood pattern, food reserves

### Nutritional Status Indicators
- **Early poor status**: Low amounts of honey and pollen
- **Nutritional stress**: Low honey stocks next to brood, no bee bread
- **Critical status**: No sealed brood, cannibalism, dead pupae and young bees
