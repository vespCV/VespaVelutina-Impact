# Quantitative Data: Arca et al. 2014

## Template-Relevant Data

### Study Design
- **Country**: France (southwest)
- **Number of apiaries**: 8 apiaries
- **Number of colonies**: 95 colonies
- **Predation levels**: Low and high levels
- **Conditions**: Natural and semi-controlled field conditions

### Experimental Setup
- **Study location**: Southwest France (point of entry of hornet in Europe)
- **Colony selection**: Subjected to either low or high levels of predation
- **Observations**: Hornet predatory behaviour and collective response of colonies under attack

### Key Findings
- **Defensive behaviour**: A. mellifera in France exhibit inefficient and unorganized defence against V. velutina
- **Comparison**: Unlike other regions where honeybees have co-evolved with Vespa predators

## Other Quantitative Data

### Context
- **V. velutina introduction**: First reported in France in 2004
- **Spread**: Extended to Spain, Portugal, and Italy
- **Estimated range (2012)**: ~360,000 km² in Europe

### Defensive Behaviours Studied
- **Balling behaviour**: Formation of ball of bees around hornet
- **Heat balling**: Used by A. cerana against V. mandarinia
- **Asphyxia-balling**: Used by A. mellifera cypria against V. orientalis
- **Bee-carpet behaviour**: Colony aggregation on beehive platform
- **Shimmering**: Synchronized abdominal shaking
- **Hissing**: Alarm sound
- **Propolis walls**: Physical barriers

### Comparison with Other Studies
- **A. cerana vs V. mandarinia**: 
  - Workers engaged: 32.2 ± 3.2 workers
  - Core temperature: 45.6 ± 0.1°C
- **A. mellifera vs V. velutina**:
  - Workers engaged: 22.7 ± 3.1 workers
  - Core temperature: 44.3 ± 0.2°C

### Impact Context
- **Colony losses in Asia**: Up to 30% (Sakagami and Akahira 1960; Ken et al. 2005)
- **Colony size comparison**: V. velutina colonies at least 3 times larger than V. crabro
- **Predation pressure**: Stronger than native European hornet
