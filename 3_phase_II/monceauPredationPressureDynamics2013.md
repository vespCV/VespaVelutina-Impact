### Climatic Data
- **Data source**: INRA weather stations via Climatik application v.1.2
- **ART weather station**: Domaine du Grand Parc (INRA, Latresne, same bank of Garonne River)
- **VIL weather station**: Located in same area as trapping site
- **Temperature**: Hourly recordings in degrees Celsius
- **Humidity**: Hourly recordings in percent
- **Wind speed**: Meters per second (only available for VIL)
- **Averaging period**: Between two consecutive collection dates

### Temperature Effects
- **Temperature effect alone**: χ²(1) = 0.83, P = 0.36 (not significant)
- **Temperature × month interaction**: χ²(6) = 36.91, P < 0.0001 (significant seasonal effect)
- **Temperature trend**: Decreased during season (Jonckheere test: ART JT = 2,283, P < 0.0001; VIL JT = 2,159.5, P < 0.0001)
- **Trapping relationship**: Increased with decreasing temperature

### Humidity Effects

- **Humidity effect analysis**: χ²(6) = 287.78, P < 0.0001

### Predation Pressure Phases
- **Phase 1**: Very few YLHs trapped from beginning of season till mid June/early July
- **Phase 2**: Large increase in predation from early August to early November
- **Phase 3**: Predation decreased drastically until December
- **Duration of increase**: Approximately 3 months
- **Delay to increase**: Approximately 44 days (ART: 42 days, VIL: 46 days)
- **Larval stage duration**: 48.1 days (from Archer 2010, varying with food quality and climate)
- **"First 40 days"**: Consistent with findings (from Spradbery 1973)

### Population Dynamics
- **Queen colony phase**: Common pattern in wasps
- **First worker emergence**: Corresponds to first phase end
- **Larva/worker ratio**: High after first workers emerge, decreases progressively until foundresses rear brood
- **Worker body mass increase**: Throughout season, related to food quality and quantity
- **November adults**: Heavier, corresponding to new generation of foundresses and males

### Site Comparison
- **Total trapped difference**: VIL had 2.07× more hornets than ART (1,894 vs 916)
- **Capture start**: ART 3 weeks earlier (16 June vs 7 July)
- **Capture end**: ART 9 days later (3 Dec vs 24 Nov)
- **Half captures reached**: ART 30 days earlier
- **Predation increase start**: ART 1 month earlier (28 July vs 22 August)
- **Hive number difference**: ART had 1.56× more hives (14 vs 9)
- **Ecosystem difference**: ART in woodland (richer arthropod prey), VIL in urban/arable land

### Management Implications
- **40-day delay**: Between first capture and appearance of first YLH hunters in apiaries (consistent in both environments)
- **Vulnerable period**: 40-day period most vulnerable stage for YLH colonies after nest initiation
- **Trapping recommendation**: Season-round trapping essential but not sufficient
- **Warning signal**: First predator captures could provide beekeepers with warning signal

### Software and Statistical Packages
- **R version**: 2.10.1 (R Development Core Team 2008)
- **Packages used**: rptR (repeatability), epicalc (overdispersion), dispmod (overdispersed Poisson), car (deviance analysis), survival (Gehan-Wilcoxon test)
