# Quantitative Data: Rojas-Nossa et al. 2022

## Template-Relevant Data

### Study Design
- **Country**: Spain (Galicia, NW Spain)
- **Start year**: 2018
- **End year**: 2020
- **Number of apiaries**: 3
- **Number of beehives**: Variable (10-20 per apiary)
- **Study duration**: 3 years (2018-2020)
- **Locations**: 
  - Oia (elevation: highest)
  - Gondomar (mid-altitude)
  - O Rosal (lowest altitude)

### Hornet Monitoring
- **Total insects captured in electric harps**: 4,359 individuals
- **V. velutina capture rate**: >90% of all insects captured
- **Mean V. velutina capture rate**: 1.6 ± 2.0 individuals/trap/day
- **Mean non-target capture rate**: 0.17 ± 0.2 individuals/trap/day
- **Selectivity of harps**: Mean ± SD = 0.75 ± 0.34
- **Capture rate variation**: Significant across time (χ² = 78.88, df = 5, P < 0.01)

### Predation Observations
- **Type of observation**: Direct observation and video
- **Observation frequency**: Variable (weekly to daily)
- **Protected vs unprotected hives**: 
  - Protected hives showed 88.8% less predation pressure than unprotected hives
  - Hunting rate of hornets (HRH) varied significantly between treatments (χ² = 42.6, df = 1, P < 0.001)
- **HRH by site**:
  - Gondomar: mean ± SD = 1.4 ± 1.41
  - Oia: mean ± SD = 0.6 ± 0.58
  - O Rosal: mean ± SD = 0.2 ± 0.28

### Colony Performance
- **Foraging activity**: Significantly affected by HRH and month (Table 1)
- **Foraging paralysis threshold**: Occurred at HRH > 0.8 hornets/hive/10 min
- **Pollen income**: Significantly affected by HRH (χ² = 33.72, P < 0.001) and month (χ² = 84.25, P < 0.001)
- **Brood**: Significantly affected by HRH (χ² = 8.30, P = 0.028) and month (χ² = 76.99, P < 0.001)
- **Foragers**: Significantly affected by HRH (χ² = 8.85, P = 0.024) and month (χ² = 67.27, P < 0.001)
- **Adults**: Significantly affected by month (χ² = 150.13, P < 0.001)

### Honeybee Weight
- **Weight difference**: Workers from unprotected hives were 6.7% lighter than those from protected hives
- **Statistical significance**: Treatment (χ² = 14.20, df = 1, P < 0.001), site (χ² = 95.77, df = 2, P < 0.001), interaction (χ² = 23.19, df = 1, P < 0.001)

### Winter Survivorship
- **Protected colonies**: 77.8% survival
- **Unprotected colonies**: 55.6% survival
- **Survivorship linked to**: Overall hunting pressure and interaction between hunting pressure and bees weight (χ² = 10.23, df = 3, P = 0.017; χ² = 11.43, df = 3, P = 0.01)
- **Not linked to**: Weight of bees alone (χ² = 0.02, df = 1, P = 0.90)

## Other Quantitative Data

### Electric Harp Specifications
- **2018 model**: 75 × 50 cm, wire separation 1.8 cm
- **2019-2020 model**: 86 × 74 cm, wire separation 2 cm
- **Height above ground**: 20-30 cm
- **Power source**: Solar panel with 6V battery backup

### Non-Target Insects Captured
- **Main non-target taxa**: Hymenopterans (A. mellifera), followed by dipterans (Sarcophagidae, Tachinidae, Calliphoridae)
- **Honeybee captures**: Consistently second most frequently trapped category
- **Honeybee capture rate**: 0.18 (much lower than V. velutina: 1.96)
- **Native insects (excluding honeybees)**: Mean 1.2% of all insects trapped (range: 0-2.4%)

### Temporal Patterns
- **Hunting activity**: General tendency to increase over study period
- **Predation peak**: Morning (similar to previous studies)
- **Activity period**: Dawn to dusk

### Resource Stores
- **Pollen stores**: Not significantly affected by predation (χ² = 0.27, P = 0.599)
- **Honey stores (uncapped)**: Not significantly affected by HRH (χ² = 0.03, P = 0.854)
- **Honey stores (capped)**: Not significantly affected by HRH (χ² = 0.31, P = 0.580)

### Management Recommendations
- **Harp placement**: One harp every two or three hives suggested
- **Hive spacing**: 20-30 cm separation between hives recommended
- **Limitations**: In highly invaded areas, harps alone may not achieve null predation; additional measures needed
