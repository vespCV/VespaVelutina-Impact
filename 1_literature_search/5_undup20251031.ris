AB  - The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina subs. nigrithorax Buysson, 1905, originally from Southeast Asia, has become an invasive species in Europe since its introduction in France around 2004. Its rapid proliferation and voracious predatory behavior pose a significant threat to native insects, particularly honeybees and other pollinators, impacting agricultural production, biodiversity, and human safety. Eradication in Europe seems now impossible, and the control efforts are hindered by the lack of standardized application protocols, including for insecticide use, leading to potential indiscriminate pesticide application and, consequently, environmental damages. Our study evaluated the acute contact toxicity on V. v. nigrithorax workers of four commercially available formulations containing acetamiprid, cypermethrin, a mix of natural pyrethrins, and Spinosad as active ingredients. These tests were performed in laboratory conditions, offering novel data for the chemical control of this invasive species. Our results suggest acetamiprid and spinosad as promising candidates for the yellow-legged hornet control. Further research is needed to validate their efficacy under field conditions and assess ecological impacts of these pesticides on non-target organisms. Integrated pest management strategies should prioritize insecticides with low non-target toxicity and minimal environmental persistence to mitigate resistance development and ensure effective pest control. Comprehensive assessments considering multiple factors beyond mortality are essential for informing sustainable pest control strategies.

AU  - Ruëff, Franziska

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Germany, honeybees (Apis mellifera) and various Vespula species (wasps) are primarily relevant for hypersensitivity reactions to stings. Hornets (Vespa crabro), bumblebees, paper wasps (Polistes) and yellowjackets (Dolichovespula) less frequently cause sting reactions. OBJECTIVE: What effects do intensive agricultural utilization and climate change have on the living conditions and occurrence of Hymenoptera and what consequences do they have for the diagnostics and treatment of hypersensitivity reactions to Hymenoptera stings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was carried out. RESULTS: Honeybees and wild bees are endangered due to introduced diseases, invasive species and pesticides. The aim of widespread beekeeping activity is to protect honeybees, which is why no reduction in stings is to be expected despite increased bee mortality. In Germany, there is evidence of the spread of thermophilic Polistes species (paper wasps) from south to north and the immigration of Vespa velutina nigrithorax (Asian hornet). It is unlikely that these species will lead to a significant increase in sting reactions. Nests of the red fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), which was originally common in South America, were first detected in Sicily in 2022. Red fire ants are aggressive insects with a high potential for adverse sting reactions. CONCLUSION: Invasive insects must be considered as a trigger in the anamnesis and diagnostics. Diagnostics are only available for the detection of Polistes sensitization. Therapeutic allergens can be obtained from other European countries for venom immunotherapy of a Polistes allergy. Due to cross-reactivity, diagnostic and therapeutic allergens from Vespula spp. are used for the diagnosis and treatment of suspected allergies to the Asian hornet.

AB  - Biological invasions have ecological impacts worldwide with potential massive economic costs. Among other ecosystem services such as nitrogen cycle, carbon sequestration and primary production, invasive alien species are particularly known to impact pollination. By predating honey bees (Apis mellifera), the invasive Yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) increases the mortality risk of European bee colonies; however, little is known about its economic costs. We developed an analytic process combining large-scale field data, niche modelling techniques and agent-based models to spatially assess the ecological and economic impacts of the Yellow-legged hornet on honey bees and beekeeping in France. In particular, we estimated (i) the hornet-related risk of bee colony mortality, (ii) the economic cost of colony loss for beekeepers and (iii) the economic impact of livestock replacement compared to honey revenues at regional and national scales. We estimated an overall density of 1.08 hornet nest/km(2) in France, based on the field record of 1260 nests over a searched area of 28,348 km(2). However, this predator density was heterogeneously spread out across the country as well as the distribution of managed honey bee colonies. Overall, this hornet-related risk of bee colony mortality could reach up to 29.2

T2  - Insects
AB  - From its introduction in Europe, Vespa velutina nigrithorax has become an invasive species, since it is a predator of native fruits and insects, most of the latter being honeybees. Despite the knowledge on the life cycle of this hornet, Asian hornet behaviour is not well understood, since in vivo studies on this species are quite difficult to perform. In this work, an observational study of the behaviour of this invasive species in captivity has been carried out. Two secondary and one embryo nests were caught and kept under controlled environmental conditions, up to 13 weeks for the secondary nest and 6 weeks for the embryo nest. Captivity adaptation, defence against perturbations, evolution of the colony and overwintering were the different behaviours studied. The study has shown the importance of avoiding disturbances to the nest from the beginning of the experiments, since they tend to destroy the colony. The aggressive behaviour observed in the embryo nest was lower than in the secondary nests. Results of this research will allow obtaining additional information on this species, which is crucial to develop effective control methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The accuracy of predictions of invasive species ranges is dependent on niche similarity between invasive and native populations and on our ability to identify the niche characteristics. With this work we aimed to compare the niche dynamics of two genetically related invasive populations of Vespa velutina (an effective predator of honeybees and wild pollinators), in two distinct climatic regions, one in central Europe and another one in the north-western Iberian Peninsula, and hence to identify uninvaded regions susceptible to invasion. METHODS: Niche dynamics and shifts of V. velutina were assessed by comparing the environmental niches of the native and of the two invasive populations, using climatic, topographic and land use variables. We also ran reciprocal distribution models using different algorithms and records from both native and invasive ranges to compare model predictions and estimate which regions are at a greater risk of being invaded. RESULTS: An apparent niche shift was detected in the population of the NW of Iberian Peninsula, where the species is living under environmental conditions different from the native niche. In central Europe, large suitable areas remain unoccupied. The fact that both invasive populations are well established, despite occupying environmentally distinct regions indicates that V. velutina has a high ability to successfully invade different environmental envelopes from those existing in its native range. For example, in north-western Iberian Peninsula the species is now thriving out of its native niche limits. Moreover, the large extent of still unoccupied environmental space with similar conditions to those used by the species in its native range suggests that there is still a large area of central and eastern Europe that can be potentially invaded by the species.

AB  - Invasion of alien species facilitated by climate change and human assistant is one of global threats that cause irreversible damages on the local flora and fauna. One of these issued species, Vespa velutina nigrithorax du Buysson, 1905 (Hymenoptera:Vespidae), is a significant threat to entomofauna, including honeybees, in the introduced regions. This wasp is still expanding its habitats, prioritizing the development of a reliable species distribution model based on recently updated occurrence data. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential areas that are climatically exposed to V. v. nigrithorax invasion globally and in South Korea, where the wasp has caused severe damage to local ecosystems and apiculture after its recent introduction. We developed a new global scale ensemble model based on CLIMEX and Maxent models and applied it to South Korea using field survey data. As a result, risky areas were predicted to be temperate and subtropical climate regions, including the eastern USA, western Europe, Far East Asia, and small areas in South America and Australia. In particular, South Korea has a high potential risk throughout the country. We expect that this study would provide fundamental data for monitoring the environmental risks caused by V. v. nigrithorax using advanced species distribution modeling.

AB  - The introduction of invasive species is considered one of the major threats to the biodiversity conservation worldwide. In recent years, an Asian invasive species of wasp has set off alarms in Europe and elsewhere in the world, Vespa velutina. The Asian wasp was accidentally introduced in France around 2004 and shortly thereafter it was able to colonise practically all of Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula. The ecological and economic implications of V. velutina invasion and its high colonisation ability have triggered widespread trapping campaigns, usually supported by beekeepers and local governments, with the aim of diminishing its population and its negative impacts. Among the most used control methods are the capture traps, which use a sugary attractant to catch the invasive wasps. However, the species-specific selectivity and efficiency of these traps has been little studied. In this paper, we have analysed the specific identity of the unintentionally trapped insect species from northern Spain (covering one-year period), as well as we have assessed the provided ecosystem services by them. A total of 74 non-target taxa of insects were caught by the V. velutina studied traps, most of them correspond to the orders Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, the dipterans being the most abundant group. Surprisingly, the most abundant trapped species was the invasive fly, Drosophila suzukii that represented the 36.07

AB  - BACKGROUND: The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, is an invasive alien species (IAS) which was accidentally introduced in Europe from Asia. This social insect preys primarily on honeybees but also on other pollinators and insects. Consequently, the establishment of this pest has a negative impact on biodiversity, pollination and economy. There is no clear coordination and uniformed methods for eradication measures between countries. Here we present the first field study of the strategy of eradication of the pest species V. velutina that has been conducted in the westernmost Mediterranean archipelago. RESULTS: We investigated the combination of different eradication methods, such as trapping; the use of the citizen science data for detection of presence, the active search of nests and the removal of nests using mechanical methods. The progression of the number of secondary nests found was 1 (2015), 9 (2016) and 20 (2017), with zero during 2018, 2019 and 2020, and just one embryo nest in 2018. More than half of the nests (58

AB  - The recent introduction of the Asian yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, into Europe has raised concern regarding the threat to honeybees and the competition with the European hornet, Vespa crabro. The aim of this study was to investigated essential (Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) elements in these two species. Element concentrations were determined in the whole body and separately in the head, thorax and abdomen using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The changes in essential element concentration and speciation during metamorphosis were also studied using size exclusion chromatography followed by AAS and proteomic analysis. In both species, the essential elements were more concentrated in the abdomen due to the presence of fat bodies. Magnesium, Fe and Zn concentrations were significantly higher in V. crabro than in V. velutina and could have been related to the higher aerobic energy demand of the former species required to sustain foraging flight. Low concentrations of Cd and Pb were indicative of low environmental exposure. The concentration and speciation of essential elements, particularly Fe, varied among the developmental stages, indicating a modification of ligand preferences during metamorphosis. Overall, the results in the present study provide a better understanding of the hornet metal metabolism and a foundation for additional studies.

T2  - Journal of environmental management
AB  - Stakeholders are critical environmental managers in human-dominated landscapes. In some contexts, stakeholders can be forced to personally act following their own observations and risk perception instead of science recommendation. In particular, biological invasions need rapid control actions to reduce potential socio-ecological impacts, while science-based risk assessments are rather complex and time-delayed. Although they can lead to important detrimental effects on biodiversity, potential time-delayed disconnections between stakeholders' action and science recommendations are rarely studied. Using the case study of western European beekeepers controlling the invasive Asian hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax for its suspected impact on honey bee colonies, we analysed mechanisms underlying personal actions of stakeholders and how they evolved in science disconnection. Personal actions of stakeholders were causal-effect linked with their risk observation but disconnected to time-delayed science predictions and recommendations. Unfortunately, these science-disconnected actions also led to dramatic impacts on numerous species of the local entomofauna. These results highlight the need to improve mutual risk communication between science and action in the early-stages of management plans to improve the sustainably of stakeholders' practices.

AB  - The yellow-legged hornet Vespa velutina has become one of the major alien species in European and East Asian countries. As in its homeland, the invading V. velutina is reported as the major predator of honeybees and is becoming a threat to beekeeping in Europe. However, it remains unknown how V. velutina might affect native hornets when it invades Asia, where a large number of Vespa species are distributed. Thus, by analyzing the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, we investigated whether interspecific mating occurs between V. velutina and Japanese native Vespa spp. Our results showed that the alien V. velutina causes reproductive interference in Japanese native hornet Vespa simillima. Forty-three percent of native V. simillima queens had the sperm of V. velutina males, and among the all V. simillima queens analyzed, 28

T2  - Ecology and evolution
AB  - In social insects, the activity rhythm of foragers and their action range determinate the activity of the colony. In vespids, which are mostly predators, the foraging range of workers determines their maximum predation pressure round the nest. One of these species, Vespa velutina, a recently invasive species introduced into Europe, exerts a strong predation on honeybees at the hive. Therefore, the definition of its activity rhythm and spatial range of predation is of primary importance. Using radio frequency identification tags (RFID), two experiments were carried out to (a) determine their return ability (called homing) in releasing 318 individuals at different distance from their colony and (b) monitor their foraging activity rhythm and the duration of their flights based on 71 individuals followed 24 hr/24 during 2 months. The homing ability of V. velutina was evaluated to be up to 5,000 m and was not affected by the cardinal orientation of release point. The lag time to return to the nest increased with the distance of release. Most of the flight activity took place between 07:00 a.m. and 08:00 p.m., hornets doing principally short flights of less than an hour. Foraging range was thus estimated ca. 1,000 m around the nest. This study of V. velutina assisted by RFID tags provides for the first time a baseline for its potential foraging distance that increase our knowledge of this species to (a) refine more accurately models for risk assessment and (b) define security perimeter for early detection of predation on invasion front.

AB  - Asian hornet, Vespa velutina Lepeletier nests were discovered in 2007 in Andernos-les-Bains on the south-west coast of France, 3 years after the first reported sightings in France. The number of nests increased in the commune over the following 7 years, despite local authorities enacting a destruction policy. The nests existed in close proximity to one another leading to a high density of over 10 nests per square kilometre in urban areas. New information on the chosen habitat for nests is presented, and the differences between primary and secondary locations are evident, with primary nests mostly occupying buildings and man-made structures, while secondary nests were found on trees. Using Bayesian inference methods, we fit a basic model to the observational data, which allows us to estimate key demographic parameters. This model fit is highly informative for predicting V. velutina spread and colonisation of other at-risk regions, and suggests that local control has a limited impact on the spread of V. velutina once established within a region.

AB  - The yellow-legged Asian hornet is an invasive species of wasps, indigenous to the Southeast Asia but recently spreading in Southern Europe. Because of its exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honeybee colonies (and to humans as well), restraint measures are currently under investigation. We developed and tested an harmonic radar capable of tracking the flying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. Several hornets were captured close to a small cluster of honeybee hives, tagged with different transponders and then released in order to follow the flight toward their nest. On-field testing proved an initial maximum detection range of about 125 m in a hilly and woody area. A number of detections were clearly recorded, and preferential directions of flight were identified. The system herein described is intended as a first low-cost harmonic radar; it proved the capability to track the hornets while flying and it permitted to test the tagging techniques. Several upgrades of the system have been identified during this work and are extensively described in the last chapter. The designed system has three major advantages over conventional harmonic radars. First and most importantly, it adopts advanced processing techniques to suppress clutter and to improve target detection. Second, it allows radar operations in complex environments, generally hilly and rich in vegetation. Finally, it can continuously track tagged insects (24/7) and in any meteorological condition, providing an effective tool in order to locate the nests of the yellow-legged Asian hornet.

T2  - Insect science
AB  - Vespa velutina is an invasive species that was observed for the first time in France and Europe in 2004, which rapidly threatened domestic honeybees with active predation. For the first time in this study, we analyzed the distribution of V. velutina nests at a local scale to understand the pattern of nesting, and in 8 years of monitoring, a total of 528 nests were surveyed. With the exception of 2 years, the nests of V. velutina were randomly distributed within the monitored area, which suggested that intraspecific competition for nesting sites and/or food was unlikely. When the data for all years were combined, an aggregated distribution of nests at the seafront in the vicinity of the oyster farm and sportfishing activities was observed. This distribution suggested that seafood, attractive to vespids, might provide a valuable alternative food source that favored colony development. We also tested the effect of spring queen trapping of V. velutina on the distribution of nests in 2014, which was the year with the greatest number of colonies within the area; the position of the traps did not influence the distribution of the nests. For the first time, this study showed that (i) intraspecific competition was unlikely to be a mechanism for population regulation, (ii) some areas were more likely favored for hornet nests, and (iii) spring queen wasp trapping was inefficient as a method to limit the distribution of the V. velutina population.

AB  - The vespine wasps, Vespa velutina, specialise in hawking honeybee foragers returning to their nests. We studied their behaviour in China using native Apis cerana and introduced A. mellifera colonies. When the wasps are hawking, A. cerana recruits threefold more guard bees to stave off predation than A. mellifera. The former also utilises wing shimmering as a visual pattern disruption mechanism, which is not shown by A. mellifera. A. cerana foragers halve the time of normal flight needed to dart into the nest entrance, while A. mellifera actually slows down in sashaying flight manoeuvres. V. velutina preferentially hawks A. mellifera foragers when both A. mellifera and A. cerana occur in the same apiary. The pace of wasp-hawking was highest in mid-summer but the frequency of hawking wasps was three times higher at A. mellifera colonies than at the A. cerana colonies. The wasps were taking A. mellifera foragers at a frequency eightfold greater than A. cerana foragers. The final hawking success rates of the wasps were about three times higher for A. mellifera foragers than for A. cerana. The relative success of native A. cerana over European A. mellifera in thwarting predation by the wasp V. velutina is interpreted as the result of co-evolution between the Asian wasp and honeybee, respectively.

AB  - Health risks caused by stings from ¡i¿Vespa velutina nigrithorax¡/i¿ (VV), also known as the yellow-legged Asian hornet, have become a public concern, but little is known about its venom composition. This study presents the proteome profile of the VV's venom sac (VS) based on Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS). The study also performed proteomic quantitative analysis and examined the biological pathways and molecular functions of the proteins in the VS of VV gynes (i.e., future queens [SQ]) and workers [SW]. The total protein content per VS was significantly higher in the SW than in the SQ (274 ± 54 µg/sac vs. 175 ± 22 µg/sac; ¡i¿p¡/i¿ = 0.02). We quantified a total of 228 proteins in the VS, belonging to 7 different classes: ¡i¿Insecta¡/i¿ (¡i¿n¡/i¿ = 191); ¡i¿Amphibia¡/i¿ and ¡i¿Reptilia¡/i¿ (¡i¿n¡/i¿ = 20); ¡i¿Bacilli¡/i¿, ¡i¿γ-Proteobacteria¡/i¿ and ¡i¿Pisoniviricetes¡/i¿ (¡i¿n¡/i¿ = 12); and ¡i¿Arachnida¡/i¿ (¡i¿n¡/i¿ = 5). Among the 228 identified proteins, 66 showed significant differential expression between SQ and SW. The potential allergens hyaluronidase A, venom antigen 5 and phospholipase A1 were significantly downregulated in the SQ venom.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the anti-inflammatory effect of wasp venom (WV) from the yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina) with that of bee venom (BV) on BV-2 murine microglial cells. WV was collected from the venom sac, freeze-dried, and used for in vitro examinations. WV and BV were non-toxic to BV-2 cells at concentrations of 160 and 12 µg/mL or lower, respectively. Treatment with WV reduced the secretion of nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, from BV-2 cells activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Western blot analysis revealed that WV and BV decreased the expression levels of inflammation markers, including inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. In addition, WV decreased the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which is a key transcription factor in the regulation of cellular inflammatory response. Cumulatively, the results demonstrated that WV inhibited LPS-induced neuroinflammation in microglial cells by suppressing the NF-κB-mediated signaling pathway, which warrants further studies to confirm its therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases.

T2  - Journal of insect physiology
AB  - Vespine wasps are known for their high endothermic capacity. Endothermic activity is directly linked to respiration. However, knowledge on wasp respiration is sparse and almost nothing is known about their resting metabolism. We investigated the yellowjackets’ CO2 production in a flow-through respirometer chamber overnight. Endothermic and behavioral activity was observed by real-time infrared thermography. Most resting wasps were ectothermic or only slightly endothermic (thoracic temperature excess against abdomen ¡ 0.6 °C). In the investigated temperature range (Ta = 2.9–42.4 °C) mean CO2 production rate of resting wasps increased steeply according to an exponential function, from 5.658 μl g−1 min−1 at 8.3 °C to 8.504 μl g−1 min−1 at 20.2 °C, 58.686 μl g−1 min−1 at 35.3 °C and 102.84 μl g−1 min−1 at 40 °C. The wasps’ respiratory critical thermal maximum (CTmax), marking the upper edge of their viable temperature range, was 45.3 °C. The respiratory CTmax did not differ significantly from the activity CTmax of 44.9 °C. CTmax values were considerably below that of honeybees (48.9 and 49.0 °C for respiration and activity, respectively). This allows honeybees to kill wasps by heat-balling. Comparison with other arthropods showed that vespine wasps are among the insects with the highest mass-specific resting metabolic rate and the steepest increase of metabolism with ambient temperature.

AB  - Managed populations of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) support the production of a global food supply. This important role in modern agriculture has rendered honey bees vulnerable to the noxious effects of anthropogenic stressors such as pesticides. Although the deleterious outcomes of lethal pesticide exposure on honey bee health and performance are apparent, the ominous role of sublethal pesticide exposure is an emerging concern as well. Here, we use a data harvesting approach to better understand the toxicological effects of pesticide exposure across the honey bee life cycle. Through compiling adult- and larval-specific median lethal dose (LD50) values from 93 published data sources, LD50 estimates for insecticides, herbicides, acaricides, and fungicides are highly variable across studies, especially for herbicides and fungicides, which are underrepresented in the meta-data set. Alongside major discrepancies in these reported values, further examination of the compiled data suggested that LD50 may not be an ideal metric for honey bee risk assessment. We also discuss how sublethal effects of pesticide exposure, which are not typically measured in LD50 studies, can diminish honey bee reproduction, immunity, cognition, and overall physiological functioning, leading to suboptimal honey bee performance and population reduction. In consideration of actionable solutions to mitigate the effects of sublethal pesticide exposure, we have identified the potential for probiotic supplementation as a promising strategy that can be easily incorporated alongside current agricultural infrastructure and apicultural management practices. Probiotic supplementation is regularly employed in apiculture but the potential for evidence-based targeted approaches has not yet been fully explored within a formal toxicological context. We discuss the benefits, practical considerations, and limitations for the use and delivery of probiotics to hives. Ultimately, by subverting the sublethal effects of pesticides we can help improve the long-term survival of these critical pollinators.

AB  - In insects, chemical communication is the most common form of communication, and cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are employed in recognition processes. In social insects, CHCs also help define colony identity and thus contribute to social cohesion among nestmates. Individuals can deposit their chemical signatures on nest surfaces. This information serves as a reference for newly emerged individuals and allows them to obtain the odor specific to their colony. This study examined nest chemical profiles in an inbred invasive species: the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax. We demonstrated that nest structures (i.e., envelopes, combs, and pillars) had specific hydrocarbon profiles, which were colony specific. There were similarities between the chemical profiles of the nests and the CHC signatures of hornets. The loss of genetic diversity previously documented in the yellow-legged hornet population in France does not appear to have constrained nest chemical diversity.

AB  - Vespa velutina nigrithorax is an invasive alien organism that has raised concerns in all beekeeping communities of invaded countries including the Republic of Korea, European countries and Japan. Known also as the yellow-legged hornet (or the 'Asian hornet'), it is native to northern India, eastern Nepal, Bhutan and the People's Republic of China. Given its climatic and biological characteristics and the effects of climate change, some coastal areas of North America, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are also susceptible to invasion. Vespa velutina nigrithorax notably affects managed honey-bee colonies by predation on foragers and causing a reduction in the collection of food resources. Being a generalist predator, the yellow-legged hornet also preys on other managed and wild pollinators, and therefore its impacts are not limited to the beekeeping sector but also represent a biodiversity concern. The purpose of this paper is to provide an assessment of V. v. nigrithorax against the four criteria established in Chapter 1.2. of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code for the inclusion of a disease, infection or infestation in the OIE list. The work was requested by the OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases and presented to this Commission and to the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission in September 2017. Owing to the lack of effective measures to prevent its spread, the fact that its legal situation in some countries is under the mandate of environmental authorities rather than Veterinary Services, and because it is not considered a disease or parasite, V. v. nigrithorax is not currently being proposed for inclusion in the OIE list. At the end of the text, the statements from the two commissions are included and discussed.

T2  - PeerJ
AB  - Background During recent years, invasion of the yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina) has occurred in Europe, Korea and Japan, and stinging accidents often occur as some V. velutina nests are in places where humans can reach them. Misleading information regarding precautionary measures for mitigating wasp attacks has only exacerbated the situation. In this study, we sought to identify appropriate countermeasures by analyzing wasp defensive behavior, with a focus on color, hair and auditory stimuli. Methods Defensive behavior was analyzed using video recordings by creating an experimental frame to attach experimental bundles to nine V. velutina nests in Daegu and Gyeongbuk, South Korea. For the color experiment, eight-color and single-color tests were conducted with bundles of eight colors (black, brown, yellow, green, orange, gray, red and white), and the difference in defensive behavior was tested between black hair/hairless and green hair/black hairless configurations. Results When presented simultaneously with bundles of eight different colors, V. velutina showed the greatest and the longest defensive behavior against the black bundle, followed by brown. A similar response was observed in single-color tests. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the defensive behavior against black hair and black hairless, but the duration of defensive behavior was longer for black hair. A comparison between green hair and black hairless stimuli indicated that wasps are more sensitive to color than to hair texture. Vespa velutina showed no discernible responses when exposed to selected auditory stimuli (human conversation and loud music). Dark colors and dark hair are characteristic features of potential predators, to which wasps are evolutionarily predisposed, and are accordingly likely to provoke strong defensive responses. The results of this study provide scientifically credible information that can be used to base appropriate precautionary measures against wasp attacks.

AB  - Insects are, by far, the most common animals on our planet. The ubiquity and plethora of ecological niches occupied by insects, along with the strict and sometimes forced coexistence between insects and humans, make insects a target of public health interest. This article reports the negative aspects historically linked to insects as pests and vectors of diseases, and describes their potential as bioindicators of environmental pollution, and their use as food and feed. Both negative and positive impacts of insects on human and animal health need to be addressed by public health professionals who should aim to strike a balance within the wide range of sometimes conflicting goals in insect management, such as regulating their production, exploiting their potential, protecting their health and limiting their negative impact on animals and humans. This requires increased insect knowledge and strategies to preserve human health and welfare. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of traditional and emerging topics bridging insects and public health to highlight the need for professionals, to address these topics during their work. The present and future role and activities of public health authorities regarding insects are analyzed.

AB  - Triatomine assassin bugs comprise hematophagous insect vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Although the microbiome of these species has been investigated to some extent, only one virus infecting Triatoma infestans has been identified to date. Here, we describe for the first time seven (+) single-strand RNA viruses (RpV1-7) infecting Rhodnius prolixus, a primary vector of Chagas disease in Central and South America. We show that the RpVs belong to the Iflaviridae, Permutotetraviridae and Solemoviridae and are vertically transmitted from the mothers to the progeny via transovarial transmission. Consistent with this, all the RpVs, except RpV2 that is related to the entomopathogenic Slow bee paralysis virus, established persistent infections in our R. prolixus colony. Furthermore, we show that R. prolixus ovaries express 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs (vsiRNAs), but not viral piRNAs, that originate from the processing of dsRNA intermediates during viral replication of the RpVs. Interestingly, the permutotetraviruses and sobemoviruses display shared pools of vsiRNAs that might provide the basis for a cross-immunity system. The vsiRNAs are maternally deposited in the eggs, where they likely contribute to reduce the viral load and protect the developing embryos. Our results unveil for the first time a complex core virome in R. prolixus and begin to shed light on the RNAi-based antiviral defenses in triatomines.

AB  - Due to its huge invasion potential and specialization in honeybee predation, the invasive hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax represents a high-concern species under both an ecological and economical perspective. In light of the development of specific odorant attractants to be used in sustainable control strategies, we carried out both behavioural assays and chemical analyses to investigate the possibility that, in the invasive population of V. velutina nigrithorax, reproductive females emit volatile pheromones to attract males, as demonstrated in a Chinese non-invasive population. We focused on the secretions produced by sternal and venom glands; because of the volatility and complexity of their composition, both of them could potentially allow an attraction and a species-specific response, decreasing therefore non-target species by-catches. Results of chemical analyses and behavioural assays showed that venom volatiles, although population-specific, are unlikely candidates as male attractants since they do not differ in composition or in quantity between reproductive females and workers and do not attract males. Conversely, sternal gland secretion differs between female castes for the presence of some ketoacids exclusive of gynes already reported as sex pheromones for the non-invasive subspecies V. velutina auraria. Despite such a difference, males are attracted by the sternal gland secretion of both workers and gynes. These results provide a first step to understand the reproductive biology of V. velutina nigrithorax in its invasive range and to develop effective and sustainable management strategies for the species.

AB  - When vespine wasps, Vespa velutina Lepeletier (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), hawk (capture) bees at their nest entrances alerted and poised guards of Apis cerana cerana F. and Apis mellifera ligustica Spinola (Hymenoptera: Apidae) have average thoracic temperatures slightly above 24° C. Many additional worker bees of A. cerana, but not A. mellifera, are recruited to augment the guard bee cohort and begin wing-shimmering and body-rocking, and the average thoracic temperature rises to 29.8 ± 1.6° C. If the wasps persist hawking, about 30 guard bees of A. cerana that have raised their thoracic temperatures to 31.4 ± 0.9° C strike out at a wasp and form a ball around it. Within about three minutes the core temperature of the heat-balling A. cerana guard bees reaches about 46° C, which is above the lethal limit of the wasps, which are therefore killed. Although guard bees of A. mellifera do not exhibit the serial behavioural and physiological changes of A. cerana, they may also heat-ball hawking wasps. Here, the differences in the sequence of changes in the behaviour and temperature during “resting” and “heat-balling” by A. cerana and A. mellifera are reported.

AB  - Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) together with Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) and Kashmir bee virus (KBV) constitute a complex of closely related dicistroviruses. They are infamous for their high mortality after injection in honeybees. These viruses have also been reported in non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators such as bumblebees, which got infected with IAPV when placed in the same greenhouse with IAPV infected honeybee hives. Here we orally infected Bombus terrestris workers with different doses of either IAPV or KBV viral particles. The success of the infection was established by analysis of the bumblebees after the impact studies: 50days after infection. Doses of 0.5×10(7) and 1×10(7) virus particles per bee were infectious over this period, for IAPV and KBV respectively, while a dose of 0.5×10(6) IAPV particles per bee was not infectious. The impact of virus infection was studied in micro-colonies consisting of 5 bumblebees, one of which becomes a pseudo-queen which proceeds to lay unfertilized (drone) eggs. The impact parameters studied were: the establishment of a laying pseudo-queen, the timing of egg-laying, the number of drones produced, the weight of these drones and worker mortality. In this setup KBV infection resulted in a significant slower colony startup and offspring production, while only the latter can be reported for IAPV. Neither virus increased worker mortality, at the oral doses used. We recommend further studies on how these viruses transmit between different pollinator species. It is also vital to understand how viral prevalence can affect wild bee populations because disturbance of the natural host-virus association may deteriorate the already critically endangered status of many bumblebee species.

AB  - Invasive species are increasingly driving biodiversity decline, and knowledge of colonization dynamics, including both drivers and dispersal modes, are important to prevent future invasions. The bee species Megachile sculpturalis (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), native to East-Asia, was first recognized in Southeast-France in 2008, and has since spread throughout much of Europe. The spread is very fast, and colonization may result from multiple fronts. To track the history of this invasion, codominant markers were genotyped using Illumina sequencing and the invasion history and degree of connectivity between populations across the European invasion axis were investigated. Distinctive genetic clusters were detected with east–west differentiations in Middle-Europe. We hypothesize that the observed cluster formation resulted from multiple, independent introductions of the species to the European continent. This study draws a first picture of an early invasion stage of this wild bee and forms a foundation for further investigations, including studies of the species in their native Asian range and in the invaded range in North America.

AB  - The Oriental hornet (¡i¿Vespa orientalis¡/i¿) is spreading across the Italian territory threatening the health and wellbeing of honeybees by feeding on adult individuals and larvae and by plundering hive resources. Considering the capacity of other hornets in harboring honeybee viruses, the aim of this study was to identify the possible role of the Oriental hornet as a vector for honeybee viruses. Adult hornets were subjected to macroscopical examination to identify the presence of lesions, and to biomolecular investigation to detect the presence of six honeybee viruses: Acute Bee Paralysis Virus (ABPV), Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV), Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV), Sac Brood Virus (SBV). No macroscopical alterations were found while biomolecular results showed that DWV was the most detected virus (25/30), followed by ABPV (19/30), BQCV (13/30), KBV (1/30) and SBV (1/30). No sample was found positive for CBPV. In 20/30 samples several co-infections were identified. The most frequent (17/30) was the association between DWV and ABPV, often associated to BQCV (9/17). One sample (1/30) showed the presence of four different viruses namely DWV, ABPV, BQCV and KBV. The detected viruses are the most widespread in apiaries across the Italian territory suggesting the possible passage from honeybees to ¡i¿V. orientalis¡/i¿, by predation of infected adult honeybees and larvae, and cannibalization of their carcasses. However, to date, it is still not clear if these viruses are replicative but we can suggest a role as mechanical vector of ¡i¿V. orientalis¡/i¿ in spreading these viruses.

T2  - Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society
AB  - The aculeate wasps are one of the most diverse and speciose insect taxa; they are omnipresent across ecosystems and exhibit diverse co-evolutionary and exploitative associations with other organisms. There is widespread conjecture that aculeate wasps are likely to perform essential ecological and economic services of importance to the health, well-being and nutritional needs of our planet. However, the scope and nature of the ecosystem services they provide are not well understood relative to other insect groups (e.g. bees, butterflies, beetles); an appreciation of their value is further tarnished by their public reputation as pointless pests. Here, we conduct the first comprehensive review of how aculeate wasps contribute to the four main areas of ecosystem services: regulatory, provisioning, supporting and cultural services. Uniting data from a large but previously disconnected literature on solitary and social aculeate wasps, we provide a synthesis on how these insects perform important ecosystem services as parasites, predators, biological indicators, pollinators, decomposers and seed dispersers; and their additional services as a sustainable alternative to meat for human consumption, and medicinal potential as sources of research leads for anti-microbials and cancer treatments. We highlight how aculeate wasps offer substantial, but largely overlooked, economic benefits through their roles in natural pest management and biological control programs. Accordingly, we provide data-driven arguments for reasons to consider the ecosystem service value of aculeate wasps on a par with other 'useful' insects (e.g. bees). Finally, we provide a research roadmap identifying the key areas of research required to capitalise better on the services provided by these important insects.

TI  - The evolutionary dynamics of biological invasions: A multi‐approach perspective
AU  - Sherpa, Stéphanie
AU  - Després, Laurence
T2  - Evolutionary applications
AB  - Biological invasions, the establishment and spread of non-native species in new regions, can have extensive economic and environmental consequences. Increased global connectivity accelerates introduction rates, while climate and land-cover changes may decrease the barriers to invasive populations spread. A detailed knowledge of the invasion history, including assessing source populations, routes of spread, number of independent introductions, and the effects of genetic bottlenecks and admixture on the establishment success, adaptive potential, and further spread, is crucial from an applied perspective to mitigate socioeconomic impacts of invasive species, as well as for addressing fundamental questions on the evolutionary dynamics of the invasion process. Recent advances in genomics together with the development of geographic information systems provide unprecedented large genetic and environmental datasets at global and local scales to link population genomics, landscape ecology, and species distribution modeling into a common framework to study the invasion process. Although the factors underlying population invasiveness have been extensively reviewed, analytical methods currently available to optimally combine molecular and environmental data for inferring invasive population demographic parameters and predicting further spreading are still under development. In this review, we focus on the few recent insect invasion studies that combine different datasets and approaches to show how integrating genetic, observational, ecological, and environmental data pave the way to a more integrative biological invasion science. We provide guidelines to study the evolutionary dynamics of invasions at each step of the invasion process, and conclude on the benefits of including all types of information and up-to-date analytical tools from different research areas into a single framework.

TI  - Evolution of the venom system in aculeate hymenoptera
AU  - Baumann, Kate
AB  - Aculeata is an extremely diverse lineage of hymenopteran insects. The name, aculeate, is derived from the Latin word aculeus meaning stinger. This refers to the defining feature of the group, a weaponised ovipositor. This weaponised ovipositor is an aculeus that is able to inject complex cocktails of bioactive molecules into prey or predators. There are over 70, 000 described species and a wide diversity of life history traits, including parasitoids, predators and pollinivores. Aculeates can be further divided into two general categories; solitary and social. In general, the venoms of solitary insects are non-lethal and paralytic allowing for feeding on prey items. Contrastingly, the venom of social insects has lost its paralytic function and is generally used for defence. Research into the venom of aculeates has only been undertaken on a few medically important species, neglecting a large portion of the group.The primary aim of this thesis was to elucidate differences in the aculeate venom system as a result of social behaviour. This was accomplished by incorporating complementary approaches of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersion spectroscopy, proteomics, transcriptomics, functional assays, and phylogenetics, providing a broad look into the complexities of the aculeate venom system.Chapter One reviews the aculeate venom system, tying together what is already known about the venom-delivery apparatus and venom composition across the group. The chapter highlights the lack of information describing venom components from solitary species and the absence of any major comparative analyses. Chapter Two provides the first insight into the morphological adaptations and metal accumulation of the aculeus in Aculeata. Chapter Three presents an in depth comparative description of the venom profiles of various solitary and social species, revealing striking differences the most likely correlate with venom use. The data explored in Chapter Four reveals the phylogenetic and evolutionary histories of the major allergen families found in hymenopteran venoms, demonstrating that most allergens are under the influence of strong negative selection.Overall this thesis provides a basis upon which to understand these understudied insect venom systems and will have wide reaching effects pertaining to the evolution and ecology of stinging bees, wasps, and ants.

T2  - Clinical kidney journal
AB  - Invasive species related to climate change and/or globalization may be associated with novel forms of kidney disease. This is the case for wasps. Several species of Asian wasps are increasingly found in America (e.g. Asian giant hornet, ¡i¿Vespa mandarinia¡/i¿) and Europe (e.g. yellow-legged Asian hornet, ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿; black shield hornet, ¡i¿V. bicolor¡/i¿; and Oriental hornet, ¡i¿V. orientalis¡/i¿). Some of these species have been associated with human deaths and acute kidney injury. The literature on wasps and acute kidney injury is scarce and mostly originates from Asia, so nephrologists outside Asia are not familiar with this health problem. In a recent issue of ¡i¿ckj¡/i¿, Liu ¡i¿et al¡/i¿. describe a simple, four-item Wasp Sting Severity Score (WSS) developed from 1131 wasp sting patients. ¡i¿Vespa mandarinia¡/i¿ and ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ were among those causing hospitalization, although most cases were caused by the black-bellied hornet (¡i¿V. basalis¡/i¿). Liu ¡i¿et al¡/i¿. propose that a WSS ≥3 should guide early (¡24 h after stings) plasma exchange, as plasma exchange was associated with lower mortality in severely affected patients but continuous venovenous haemofiltration and haemoperfusion were not. The WSS will require external validation. This manuscript should raise awareness about the potentially fatal consequences of stings by wasp species making their way into America and Europe.

AB  - Abstract The Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) also entitled ‘Colony Loss’ has a significant impact on the biodiversity, on the pollination of crops and on the profitability. The Internet of Things associated with cloud computing offers possibilities to collect and treat a wide range of data to monitor and follow the health status of the colon. The surveillance of the animals’ pollination by collecting data at large scale is an important issue in order to ensure their survival and pollination, which is mandatory for food production. Moreover, new network technologies like Low Power Wide Area (LPWAN) or 3GPP protocols and the appearance on the market easily programmable nodes allow to create, at low-cost, sensors and effectors for the Internet of Things. In this paper, we propose a technical solution easily replicable, based on accurate and affordable sensors and a cloud architecture to monitor and follow bees’ behavior. This solution provides a platform for researchers to better understand and measure the impacts factors which lead to the mass extinction of bees. The suggested model is also a digital and useful tool for beekeepers to better follow up with their beehives. It helps regularly inspect their hives to check the health of the colony. The massive collection of data opens new research for a better understanding of factors that influence the life of bees.

AB  - Varroa destructor is the most important ectoparasitic mite of honey bees that has a negative impact on bee health and honey production. The control programs are mainly based on the use of synthetic acaricides that are often administered indiscriminately. All this has led to drug resistance that now represent a great concern for honey bee farming. The research for alternative products/methods for mites’ control is now mandatory. The aim of this study was to test whether Citrus spp. essential oils could diminish the growth of the V. destructor mite. In Calabria (southern Italy), plants of the Citrus genus are very common and grow both spontaneously and cultured. The essential oils used in this study were extracted from bergamot (Citrus bergamia), grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), lemon (Citrus limon), orange (Citrus sinensis), and mandarin (Citrus reticulata) by hydrodistillation. Every EO was in vitro tested against V. destructor. Each experimental replicate was performed using 35 viable adult female mites (5 for each EO) collected the same day from the same apiary and included negative controls (5 individuals exposed to acetone only) and positive controls (5 individuals exposed to Amitraz diluted in acetone). The essential oils (Eos) were diluted (0.5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 2 mg/mL) in HPLC grade acetone to obtain the working solution to be tested (50 µL/tube). Mite mortality was manually assessed after 1 h exposure under controlled conditions. The essential oils that showed the best effectiveness at 0.5 mg/mL were bergamot, which neutralized (dead + inactivated) 80

AB  - Invasive social insect populations that have been introduced to a new environment through a limited number of introduction events generally exhibit reduced variability in their chemical signatures (cuticular hydrocarbons) compared to native populations of the same species. The reduced variability in these major recognition cues could be caused by a reduction of genetic diversity due to a genetic bottleneck. This hypothesis was tested in an inbred European population of the invasive hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax. Our results show that, in spite of the limited amount of genetic diversity present in the European population, the chemical signatures of individuals were highly heterogeneous according to their caste, sex, and colony origin. In queens, some specific saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons were identified. These results suggest that epigenetic and/or environmental factors could play a role in modifying cuticular hydrocarbon profiles in this introduced hornet population despite the observed reduction of genetic diversity.

T2  - Saudi journal of biological sciences
AB  - Abstract Objectives The species Palarus latifrons (bee pirates) has been recorded in Saudi Arabia as an invasive species. This pest can destroy honey bee colonies under certain conditions. The origin of this species in Africa and it has a good ability to adapt to desert conditions. Studies on this species are very few but its current distribution in the Arabian deserts is mainly in the Arabian Gulf countries. This study presents maps for the possible expansion of this species to invade other desert areas in the Arabian countries’ under current and near-future conditions (2030). Methods This pest is a solitary insect with high activity during summer. It is hypothesized that summer conditions and especially temperature are the limiting factor for its distribution in the deserts. The analysis depended on generating maps based on temperatures during summer and based on two bioclimatic factors. Maxent and the geographical information system (GIS) were used to perform the analysis. Results and conclusions All maps showed the high ability of this pest to spread in the Gulf countries. In North Africa: south Egypt and Libya, and some parts of Algeria showed suitability for Palarus. The invasion of this pest towards North Africa can happen mostly due to trading activities with Gulf countries especially materials containing soil. Continues monitoring for the activity of Palarus in the risk areas is highly advised.

T2  - Journal of Applied Ecology
AB  - Summary The invasive yellow-legged hornet was first discovered in Europe, in south-western France, in 2004. It has since spread very rapidly and has caused significant mortality among honeybees and native entomofauna. It also poses a risk to humans because its sting provokes allergic reactions. The objectives of this study were the following: (i) to disentangle the roles played by human-mediated dispersal and self-mediated dispersal in the species' rapid range expansion and (ii) to estimate the intensity of control measures in France and determine what needs to be done to slow the hornet's spread and dramatically reduce its population densities. A mathematical model was developed to describe the hornet's potential spread. This model included parameters describing the population growth rate, carrying capacity, self-mediated dispersal, human-mediated dispersal and the efficacy of control measures (i.e. the destruction of detected nests). Model parameters were estimated using 2004–2009 occurrence data for France and the model was then validated using 2013 occurrence data. Several scenarios were tested: human-mediated dispersal was present or absent and control intensity varied. Then, the species' spread in coming years was simulated (from 2013 to 2020). Despite some uncertainty on the value of the parameters, this model is relatively robust. Human-mediated dispersal may not be necessarily responsible for the hornet's rapid range expansion; the species could spread rapidly on its own. It is likely that to date, an average of 30–40

T2  - Frontiers in immunology
AB  - Allergic reactions to stings of Hymenoptera species may be severe and are potentially fatal deviations of the immunological response observed in healthy individuals. However, venom-specific immunotherapy (VIT) is an immunomodulatory approach able to cure venom allergy in the majority of affected patients. An appropriate therapeutic intervention and the efficacy of VIT not only depend on a conclusive diagnosis, but might also be influenced by the patient-specific manifestation of the disease. As with other diseases, it should be borne in mind that there are different endotypes and phenotypes of venom allergy, each of which require a patient-tailored disease management and treatment scheme. Reviewed here are different endotypes of sting reactions such as IgE-mediated allergy, asymptomatic sensitization or a simultaneous presence of venom allergy and mast cell disorders including particular considerations for diagnosis and therapy. Additionally, phenotypical manifestations of venom allergy, as e.g. differences in age of onset and disease severity, multiple sensitization or patients unsusceptible to therapy, are described. Moreover, biomarkers and diagnostic strategies that might reflect the immunological status of the patient and their value for therapeutic guidance are discussed. Taken together, the increasing knowledge of different disease manifestations in venom hypersensitivity and the growing availability of diagnostic tools open new options for the classification of venom allergy and, hence, for personalized medical approaches and precision medicine in Hymenoptera venom allergy.

All traps used now, to try to control this species, seem to be not efficient enough and non-selective. However, in the current context of massive disappearance of insects in general, it is urgent to find means of protection for the entomofauna. While no selective trapping is still occurring, we performed a pilot study to test a carnivorous plant as a potential biocontrol tool to trap ¡jats:italic¿V.velutina¡/jats:italic¿. In our study, we analyzed the hornet-capturing ability of two ¡jats:italic¿Sarracenia¡/jats:italic¿ hybrids (¡jats:italic¿S.juthatipsoper¡/jats:italic¿ and ¡jats:italic¿S.evendine¡/jats:italic¿) on a 2-years period (2015 and 2016). Our results show that these plants trapped more dipterans than other taxa, and they do not attract many hornets. In such condition, both ¡jats:italic¿Sarracenia¡/jats:italic¿ hybrids cannot therefore be used in a mass trapping system, because they are not selective, and too few hornets are trapped.

AB  - Invasive species become established in non-native areas due to their intrinsic characteristics and the ability to adapt to new environments. This work describes the characteristics of the nesting behavior of the invasive yellow-legged hornet (¡i¿Vespa velutina nigrithorax¡/i¿) in Galicia (Northwest Spain). The first nest was detected in the area in 2012 and after that, the distribution pattern shows a species-invasion curve with slow progress at first but followed by rapid expansion. The nesting places for this hornet differ between the kinds of nests, while embryo nests are mainly found in buildings in spring, secondary nests are observed in vegetation in summer, autumn, and winter. The annual life cycle starts when the queen builds the embryo nests and starts to lay eggs. This leads to the emergence of the first workers, usually small in size, and sometimes a few males. After this stage, large nests called secondary nests are normally observed in most exposed sites. Relocation nests can also be observed; these are nests in the first stage of development presenting adults insects but without brood or meconium. The period of decline is characterized by the emergence of new queens and males, that are distinguishable even in the pupal stage, the appearance of two eggs per cell, and an irregular brood pattern.

AB  - Vespa velutina nigrithorax is an invasive alien social wasp species known as harmful for its effective prey pressure on Apis mellifera . The aim of this work was to assess the presence of V. v. nigrithorax two years after the first capture in North West Italy, to evaluate its relative abundance and dominance in the social wasp communities sampled by means of bait-traps, and to describe some biological and nesting activity. V. v. nigrithorax was trapped or observed in 4 localities in Piedmont and in 10 localities in Liguria, from 20 m a.s.l. up to 1100 m a.s.l. Five embryo and eight developed nests were counted in eight different localities. V. v. nigrithorax was a subdominant species in the social wasp community trapped at Giardini Hanbury (Liguria). At present, V. v. nigrithorax is spreading in North West of Italy at a rate of 10-20 Km per year and measures for its spatial containment should be urgently implemented.

AB  - An eco-monitoring program to assess the biodiversity of insects affected by yellow-legged hornet (¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿) trapping in the north of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) revealed the first occurrence of the southern giant hornet ¡i¿Vespa soror¡/i¿ (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) on the European continent. We present a detailed characterization, combining morphological characteristics and molecular tools for genetic identification, as well as key information on its identification with respect to other hornets found on the Iberian Peninsula. We discuss the most plausible pathways and vectors of introduction, its potential invasiveness, and subsequent impacts on host localities. Our preliminary results raise concerns about the potential threat of ¡i¿V. soror¡/i¿ to human health and ecosystem dynamics, as it is a highly predatory species on other insects and even small vertebrates. Finally, this study confirms once again the usefulness of studying insects trapped in such traps for rapid response and early detection of inland invasive species. We also propose a common Spanish name for the species, "avispón sóror".

AB  - Information concerning the pathogenic role of honey bee viruses in invasive species are still scarce. The aim of this investigation was to assess the presence of several honey bee viruses, such as Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV), Slow Paralysis Virus (SPV), Sac Brood Virus (SBV), Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV), Acute Bee Paralysis Virus (ABPV), Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV), in Vespa velutina specimens collected in Italy during 2017. Results of this investigation indicate that among pathogens, replicative form of KBV and BQCV were detected, assessing the spillover effect of both these viruses from managed honey bees to hornets.

AB  - Ongoing honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony losses are of significant international concern because of the essential role these insects play in pollinating crops. Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to colony failure; however, the potential role(s) of commonly-used neonicotinoid insecticides has emerged as particularly concerning. Neonicotinoids act on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous system to eliminate pest insects. However, mounting evidence indicates that neonicotinoids also may adversely affect beneficial pollinators, such as the honey bee, via impairments on learning and memory, and ultimately foraging success. The specific mechanisms linking activation of the nAChR to adverse effects on learning and memory are uncertain. Additionally, clear connections between observed impacts on individual bees and colony level effects are lacking. The objective of this review was to develop adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) as a means to evaluate the biological plausibility and empirical evidence supporting (or refuting) the linkage between activation of the physiological target site, the nAChR, and colony level consequences. Potential for exposure was not a consideration in AOP development and therefore this effort should not be considered a risk assessment. Nonetheless, development of the AOPs described herein has led to the identification of research gaps which, for example, may be of high priority in understanding how perturbation of pathways involved in neurotransmission can adversely affect normal colony functions, causing colony instability and subsequent bee population failure. A putative AOP network was developed, laying the foundation for further insights as to the role of combined chemical and non-chemical stressors in impacting bee populations. Insights gained from the AOP network assembly, which more realistically represents multi-stressor impacts on honey bee colonies, are promising toward understanding common sensitive nodes in key biological pathways and identifying where mitigation strategies may be focused to reduce colony losses.

AB  - The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina (Lepeletier), is a pest of concern outside of its native range. Vespa velutina is native to Southeast Asia and has invaded several regions in Europe, first appearing in France in 2004. As a generalist predator, they are a pest of honey bees and a major concern to many beekeepers. Vespa velutina has not been intercepted in North America, but it is believed to have high invasion potential.

The objective was to evaluate, during 24 months, the relationships between tending ants, Hemiptera phytophagous, predators and their distribution pattern (aggregated, random or uniform). The arthropods were sampled, stored and identified and their relationships and distribution patterns calculated with the BioDiversity-Pro software. The number of tending ants and phytophagous Hemiptera, Brachymyrmex sp. and Aethalion reticulatum, Cephalotes and Aleyrodidae were positively correlated. Tending ants were negatively correlated with Sternorrhyncha predators on A. auriculiformis saplings. The distribution of arthropods was aggregated, except for Teudis sp. and Cephalocoema sp., with a random pattern. The herbivores Stereoma anchoralis, Aethalion reticulatum and Tetragonisca angustula and the predators Brachymyrmex sp. and Dolichopodidae were the most abundant arthropods. The relationships between the arthropods studied on A. auriculiformis indicate that this plant, even introduced, is suitable for programs to recover degraded areas in the savannah.

AB  - Edible insects have great potential to be human food; among them, aquatic insects have unique characteristics and deserve special attention. Before consuming these insects, the nutrition and food safety should always be considered. In this review, we summarized the species diversity, nutrition composition, and food safety of edible aquatic insects, and also compared their distinguished characteristics with those of terrestrial insects. Generally, in contrast with the role of plant feeders that most terrestrial edible insect species play, most aquatic edible insects are carnivorous animals. Besides the differences in physiology and metabolism, there are differences in fat, fatty acid, limiting/flavor amino acid, and mineral element contents between terrestrial and aquatic insects. Furthermore, heavy metal, pesticide residue, and uric acid composition, concerning food safety, are also discussed. Combined with the nutritional characteristics of aquatic insects, it is not recommended to eat the wild resources on a large scale. For the aquatic insects with large consumption, it is better to realize the standardized cultivation before they can be safely eaten.

AB  - Vespa velutina has been rapidly expanding throughout Galicia since 2012. It is causing human health risks and well-known losses in the beekeeping sector. Control methods are scarce, unspecific, and ineffective. Semiochemicals are insect-derived chemicals that play a role in communication and they could be used an integrated pest management tool alternative to conventional pesticides. A previous determination of the organic chemical profile should be the first step in the study of these semiochemicals. HS-SPME in living individuals and the sting apparatus extraction followed by GC-MS spectrometry were combined to extract a possible profile of these compounds in 43 hornets from Galicia. The identified compounds were hydrocarbons, ketones, terpenes, and fatty acid, and fatty acid esters. Nonanal aldehyde appeared in important concentrations in living individuals. While pentadecane, 8-hexyl- and ethyl oleate were mainly extracted from the venom apparatus. Ketones 2-nonanone, 2-undecanone and 7-nonen-2-one, 4,8-dimethyl- were identified by both procedures, as was 1,7-Nonadiene, 4,8-dimethyl-. Some compounds were detected for the first time in V. velutina such as naphthalene, 1,6-dimethyl-4-(1-methylethyl). The chemical profile by caste was also characterized.

AB  - Animal venoms can play an important role in drug discovery, as they are a rich source of evolutionarily tuned compounds that target a variety of ion channels and receptors. To date, there are six FDA-approved drugs derived from animal venoms, with recent work using high-throughput platforms providing a variety of new therapeutic candidates. However, high-throughput methods for screening animal venoms against purinoceptors, one of the oldest signaling receptor families, have not been reported. Here, we describe a variety of quantitative fluorescent-based high-throughput screening (HTS) cell-based assays for screening animal venoms against ligand-gated P2X receptors. A diverse selection of 180 venoms from arachnids, centipedes, hymenopterans, and cone snails were screened, analyzed, and validated, both analytically and pharmacologically. Using this approach, we performed screens against human P2X3, P2X4, and P2X7 using three different fluorescent-based dyes on stable cell lines and isolated the active venom components. Our HTS assays are performed in 96-well format and allow simultaneous screening of multiple venoms on multiple targets, improving testing characteristics while minimizing costs, specimen material, and testing time. Moreover, utilizing our assays and applying them to the other natural product libraries, rather than venoms, might yield other novel natural products that modulate P2X activity.

In the Azores, terrestrial arthropods are relatively well-inventoried following the publication of comprehensive checklists that have been regularly updated. Nevertheless, every year, new species are found as a result of new arrivals to the Archipelago and from addressing specific taxonomic lacunae. Here, we update the taxonomic terrestrial arthropod biodiversity of the Azores by reporting for the first time 13 species for the Archipelago, namely ¡i¿Oligonychusperseae¡/i¿ Tuttle, Baker & Abbatiello, 1976, ¡i¿Textrixpinicola¡/i¿ Simon, 1875, ¡i¿Pholcommagibbum¡/i¿ (Westring, 1851), ¡i¿Schistocercagregaria¡/i¿ (Forsskål, 1775), ¡i¿Phoracantharecurva¡/i¿ Newman, 1840, ¡i¿Diachusauratus¡/i¿ Fabricius, 1801 ¡i¿Phyllotretaprocera¡/i¿ (Redtenbacher, 1849), ¡i¿Phyllotretastriolata¡/i¿ (Fabricius, 1803), ¡i¿Diboliaoccultans¡/i¿ (Koch, 1803), ¡i¿Pseudolynchiacanariensis¡/i¿ (Macquart, 1839), ¡i¿Hermetiaillucens¡/i¿ (Linnaeus, 1758), ¡i¿Dryocosmuskuriphilus¡/i¿ Yasumatsu, 1951 and ¡i¿Ectemniuscephalotes¡/i¿ (Olivier, 1792), and several new species records for specific islands. These species benefitted from the increase in transportation of goods and commodities, both from outside the Archipelago and between islands, to arrive and spread across the Archipelago with some of them posing new challenges to local agriculture, forestry and biodiversity conservation management.

Parasitism by this species has been associated with infested bees absconding the hive and dying outside. The flies can also harbour viral infections and nosematosis. Recently, nucleotide sequences identical to ¡jats:italic¿A. borealis¡/jats:italic¿ were reported from bulk screenings of honey bees from Belgium and South Korea, although no adult flies have been collected. To predict the potential invasion risk of ¡jats:italic¿A. borealis¡/jats:italic¿ across the world, we constructed a MaxEnt species distribution model based on occurrence data from North America submitted to the citizen science project ZomBee Watch (zombeewatch.org) and from museum specimens. The results have shown that extensive parts of Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, Asia Minor, southern Africa, eastern Asia, Australasia, and North and South America have high degrees of climatic suitability for invasion, suggesting that the fly could establish in these regions. The potential invasion range is expected to stay similar under different climate change scenarios. We discuss the status of ¡jats:italic¿A. borealis¡/jats:italic¿ as an invasive species and measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of its introduction outside of North America. Our results highlight ¡jats:italic¿A. borealis¡/jats:italic¿ as a potential threat to honey bee health worldwide that requires urgent attention of international veterinary bodies to prevent its spread.¡/jats:p¿

T2  - PloS one
AB  - The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax (Hymenoptera: Vespidae, Lepeletier 1836), is native to Southeast Asia and has been unintentionally introduced in France. The species is spreading in many areas of the world. The European Union has classified V. velutina as a species of concern because the hornet significantly affects beekeeping activities, mostly by preying honeybees (Apis mellifera) at beehive entrances. No current control method is simultaneously eco-friendly and effective. Here, we aimed to develop a greener technique for destroying V. velutina nests, inspired by a defense behavior used by the eastern honeybee (Apis cerana), the "heat ball". In the laboratory, we tested how V. velutina of different sexes, castes, and developmental stages responded to different heat exposure systems employing a range of temperature levels. Overall, the time of death decreased as temperature increased. Hornets died faster when the temperature was gradually increased than when it was instantaneously increased; larvae seemed to be more thermally tolerant. The most promising and potential technique for quickly destroying hornet nests may be steam injection, as the humid airflow system killed all hornets within 13 seconds, and therefore could be a good candidate for a green nest control method.

AB  - Venoms of invertebrates contain an enormous diversity of proteins, peptides, and other classes of substances. Insect venoms are characterized by a large interspecific variation resulting in extended lists of venom compounds. The venom composition of several hymenopterans also shows different intraspecific variation. For instance, venom from different honeybee castes, more specifically queens and workers, shows quantitative and qualitative variation, while the environment, like seasonal changes, also proves to be an important factor. The present study aimed at an in-depth analysis of the intraspecific variation in the honeybee venom proteome. In summer workers, the recent list of venom proteins resulted from merging combinatorial peptide ligand library sample pretreatment and targeted tandem mass spectrometry realized with a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS/MS). Now, the same technique was used to determine the venom proteome of queens and winter bees, enabling us to compare it with that of summer bees. In total, 34 putative venom toxins were found, of which two were never described in honeybee venoms before. Venom from winter workers did not contain toxins that were not present in queens or summer workers, while winter worker venom lacked the allergen Api m 12, also known as vitellogenin. Venom from queen bees, on the other hand, was lacking six of the 34 venom toxins compared to worker bees, while it contained two new venom toxins, in particularly serine proteinase stubble and antithrombin-III. Although people are hardly stung by honeybees during winter or by queen bees, these newly identified toxins should be taken into account in the characterization of a putative allergic response against Apis mellifera stings.

AB  - Close-range photogrammetry and thermographic imaging techniques are used for the acquisition of all the data needed for the non-invasive assessment of a honeybee hive population. Temperature values complemented with precise 3D geometry generated using novel close-range photogrammetric and computer vision algorithms are used for the computation of the inner beehive temperature at each point of its surface. The methodology was validated through its application to three reference beehives with different population levels. The temperatures reached by the exterior surfaces of the hives showed a direct correlation with the population level. In addition, the knowledge of the 3D reality of the hives and the position of each temperature value allowed the positioning of the bee colonies without the need to open the hives. This way, the state of honeybee hives regarding the growth of population can be estimated without disturbing its natural development.

AB  - By providing pollination services, bees are among the most important insects, both in ecological and economical terms. Combined next-generation and classical sequencing approaches were applied to discover and study new insect viruses potentially harmful to bees. A bioinformatics virus discovery pipeline was used on individual Illumina transcriptomes of 13 wild bees from three species from the genus Halictus and 30 ants from six species of the genera Messor and Aphaenogaster. This allowed the discovery and description of three sequences of a new virus termed Halictus scabiosae Adlikon virus (HsAV). Phylogenetic analyses of ORF1, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) and capsid genes showed that HsAV is closely related to (+)ssRNA viruses of the unassigned Sinaivirus genus but distant enough to belong to a different new genus we called Halictivirus. In addition, our study of ant transcriptomes revealed the first four sinaivirus sequences from ants (Messor barbarus, M. capitatus and M. concolor). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed on a 594 nt fragment of the ORF1/RdRp region from 84 sinaivirus sequences, including 31 new Lake Sinai viruses (LSVs) from honey bees collected in five countries across the globe and the four ant viral sequences. The phylogeny revealed four main clades potentially representing different viral species infecting honey bees. Moreover, the ant viruses belonged to the LSV4 clade, suggesting a possible cross-species transmission between bees and ants. Lastly, wide honey bee screening showed that all four LSV clades have worldwide distributions with no obvious geographical segregation.

Here, we review the current literature on the recent advances in understanding the transmission of viruses, both on the presence of bee viruses in Apis and non-Apis bee species and on the discovery of previously unknown bee viruses. The natural transmission of bee viruses will be discussed among different bee species and other insects. Finally, the research potential of in vivo (host organisms) and in vitro (cell lines) serial passages of bee viruses is discussed, from the perspective of the host-virus landscape changes and potential transmission routes for emerging bee virus infections.

AB  - Predator–prey relationships between sympatric species allow the evolution of defense behaviors, such as honeybee colonies defending their nests against predatory wasps. We investigated the predator–prey relationship between the honeybee (Apis mellifera ligustica) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica) by evaluating the effectiveness of attack and defense behaviors, which have coevolved in these sympatric species, as well as the actual damage and disturbance caused to the colonies under attack. Attack and defense behaviors were recorded in front of the hive to observe attacks at the hive entrance (68 attacks in 279 h) and at ground level on isolated and weakened honeybees close to the hive (465 attacks in 32 h). We found that V. germanica attacked the hive entrance infrequently due to the low success rate of this strategy and instead preferred a specialized attack method targeting adult honeybees at ground level, demonstrating opportunistic scavenger behavior. Individual honeybees usually responded effectively to an attack by recruiting an average of two nestmates, causing the wasp to flee, whereas collective balling behavior was only observed on four occasions. V. germanica does not appear to disrupt the foraging activity of the colonies under attack. We found that agonistic events supported by other nestmates were typically the most intense ones, involving physical combat and prolonged attacks at the entrance to the hive. These observations support the hypothesis that A. mellifera ligustica can adapt its behavior to match the severity of the threat and the context of the attack.

AB  - Vespid wasps are ecologically beneficial, but they can be a nuisance and dangerous to people due to their tendency to sting. Here, the aim was to screen samples of volatiles (i.e., essential oils and pure chemicals) for their repellency against wasps. The number of wasps (mainly Vespula vulgaris) present in a glass box with attractant and 5 µL sample was compared to the number of wasps in a similar box with attractant only. Both boxes were connected to a large glass container harboring 18–35 wasps. Among 66 tested samples, some essential oils from Lamiaceae and Asteraceae, as well as some pure natural compounds such as the monoterpenes (−)-terpinen-4-ol and isopulegol showed a significant repellency against vespids. Our results corroborate the potential of (mixtures of) volatiles in repelling these insects.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - Beetles comprise about 400,000 described species, nearly one third of all known animal species. The enormous success of the order Coleoptera is reflected by a rich diversity of lifestyles, behaviors, morphological, and physiological adaptions. All these evolutionary adaptions that have been driven by a variety of parameters over the last about 300 million years, make the Coleoptera an ideal field to study the evolution of the brain on the interface between the basic bauplan of the insect brain and the adaptions that occurred. In the current study we concentrated on the paired antennal lobes (AL), the part of the brain that is typically responsible for the first processing of olfactory information collected from olfactory sensilla on antenna and mouthparts. We analyzed 63 beetle species from 22 different families and thus provide an extensive comparison of principal neuroarchitecture of the AL. On the examined anatomical level, we found a broad diversity including AL containing a wide range of glomeruli numbers reaching from 50 to 150 glomeruli and several species with numerous small glomeruli, resembling the microglomerular design described in acridid grasshoppers and diving beetles, and substructures within the glomeruli that have to date only been described for the small hive beetle, Aethina tumida. A first comparison of the various anatomical features of the AL with available descriptions of lifestyle and behaviors did so far not reveal useful correlations. In summary, the current study provides a solid basis for further studies to unravel mechanisms that are basic to evolutionary adaptions of the insect olfactory system.

AB  - Large numbers of chemosensory genes have been identified in the peripheral sensory organs of the pest ¡i¿Mythimna separata¡/i¿ (Walker) to increase our understanding of chemoreception-related molecular mechanisms and to identify molecular targets for pest control. Chemosensory-related genes are expressed in various tissues, including non-sensory organs, and they play diverse roles. To better understand the functions of chemosensory-related genes in non-sensory organs, transcriptomic analyses of ¡i¿M. separata¡/i¿ brains were performed. In total, 29 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and 16 chemosensory proteins (CSPs) putative genes were identified in the transcriptomic data set. The further examination of sex- and tissue-specific expression using RT-PCR suggested that eight ¡i¿OBPs¡/i¿ (¡i¿OBP5¡/i¿, ¡i¿-7¡/i¿, ¡i¿-11¡/i¿, ¡i¿-13¡/i¿, ¡i¿-16¡/i¿, ¡i¿-18¡/i¿, ¡i¿-21¡/i¿, and ¡i¿-24¡/i¿) and eight ¡i¿CSPs¡/i¿ (¡i¿CSP2¡/i¿-¡i¿4¡/i¿, ¡i¿-8¡/i¿, ¡i¿CSP10¡/i¿-¡i¿12¡/i¿, and ¡i¿-15¡/i¿) genes were expressed in the brain. Furthermore, bands representing most ¡i¿OBPs¡/i¿ and ¡i¿CSPs¡/i¿ could be detected in antennae, except for a few that underwent sex-biased expression in abdomens, legs, or wings. An RT-qPCR analysis of the expression profiles of six ¡i¿OBPs¡/i¿ (¡i¿OBP3-5¡/i¿, ¡i¿-9¡/i¿, ¡i¿-10¡/i¿, and ¡i¿-16¡/i¿) and two ¡i¿CSPs¡/i¿ (¡i¿CSP3¡/i¿ and ¡i¿CSP4¡/i¿) in different tissues and sexes indicated that ¡i¿OBP16¡/i¿ was highly expressed in male brain, and ¡i¿CSP3¡/i¿ and ¡i¿CSP4¡/i¿ were female-biased and highly expressed in brain. The expression levels of ¡i¿OBP5¡/i¿ and ¡i¿OBP10¡/i¿ in brain were not significantly different between the sexes. The findings expand our current understanding of the expression patterns of ¡i¿OBP¡/i¿s and ¡i¿CSP¡/i¿s in ¡i¿M. separata¡/i¿ sensory and non-sensory tissues. These results provide valuable reference data for exploring novel functions of OBPs and CSPs in ¡i¿M. separata¡/i¿ and may help in developing effective biological control strategies for managing this pest by exploring novel molecular targets.

AB  - Vespa velutina and V. crabro are eusocial insects in which chemical communication is decisive for social interactions. V. velutina was accidentally introduced in 2004 in France and subsequently in northern Spain in 2010. It is an invasive species that severely affects the beekeeping sector. The hornet autochthonous V. crabro with a similar ecological niche is captured in bait traps used to control V. velutina populations. Insect cuticle and head structures had an important role in chemical communication so that this research approaches for the first time chemical compounds extracted from the heads of V. velutina and V. crabro. Chemical compounds were profiled using GC/MS. The main compounds identified were carbohydrates, fatty acids, and hydrocarbons. The chemical profile of both species was compared and also an intrinsic differentiation was made between queens and workers in V. velutina. Chemometric techniques (PCA and LSD) were used to achieve this goal.

AB  - †Background and Aims Winter-flowering plants outside the tropics may experience a shortage of pollinator service, given that insect activity is largely limited by low temperature. Birds can be alternative pollinators for these plants, but experimental evidence for the pollination role of birds in winter-flowering plants is scarce. †Methods Pollinator visitation to the loquat, Eriobotrya japonica (Rosaceae), was observed across the flowering season from November to January for two years in central China. Self- and cross-hand pollination was conducted in the field to investigate self-compatibility and pollen limitation. In addition, inflorescences were covered by bird cages and nylon mesh nets to exclude birds and all animal pollinators, respectively, to investigate the pollination role of birds in seed production. †Results Self-fertilization in the loquat yielded few seeds. In early winter insect visit frequency was relatively higher, while in late winter insect pollinators were absent and two passerine birds (Pycnonotus sinensis and Zosterops japonicus) became the major floral visitors. However, seed-set of open-pollinated flowers did not differ between early and late winter. Exclusion of bird visitation greatly reduced seed-set, indicating that passerine birds were important pollinators for the loquat in late winter. The whitish perigynous flowers reward passerines with relatively large volumes of dilute nectar. Our observation on the loquat and other Rosaceae species suggested that perigyny might be related to bird pollination but the association needs further study. †Conclusions These findings suggest that floral traits and phenology would be favoured to attract bird pollinators in cold weather, in which insect activity is limited.

AB  - Species introduced outside their natural range threaten global biodiversity and despite greater awareness of invasive species risks at ports and airports, control measures in place only concern anthropogenic routes of dispersal. Here, we use the Harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis, an invasive species which first established in the UK from continental Europe in 2004, to test whether records from 2004 and 2005 were associated with atmospheric events. We used the atmospheric- chemistry transport model SILAM to model the movement of this species from known distributions in continental Europe and tested whether the predicted atmospheric events were associated with the frequency of ladybird records in the UK. We show that the distribution of this species in the early years of its arrival does not provide substantial evidence for a purely anthropogenic introduction and show instead that atmospheric events can better explain this arrival event. Our results suggest that air flows which may assist dispersal over the English Channel are relatively frequent; ranging from once a week from Belgium and the Netherlands to 1–2 times a week from France over our study period. Given the frequency of these events, we demonstrate that atmospheric-assisted dispersal is a viable route for flying species to cross natural barriers.

AB  - La cueillette du miel de l’abeille geante de l’Himalaya, Apis laboriosa, dans les montagnes de l’Annapurna (Nepal) est l’objet de nombreux reportages et documentaires. Suspendus dans le vide, de courageux cueilleurs recoltent de gigantesques rayons de cire a l’aide de longues tiges de bambou. Ces images font le tour du monde pour montrer les hauts lieux de cueillette, les falaises de Bhujung. Chaque annee, des centaines de touristes viennent assister au spectacle en plein air. Dans ce village, il n’est pas rare non plus de voir des ruches troncs accrochees sous des toits ou des loges creusees pour les abeilles dans des facades de maison. Plus generalement, dans les regions rurales du Nepal, l’elevage de l’abeille asiatique, Apis cerana, est couramment pratique. Lorsque son apiculture s’inscrit dans une logique commerciale, elle implique cependant un investissement financier et des connaissances techniques qui peuvent etre un frein a son developpement. Dans le village de Bhujung, les habitants ne semblent pas prets a s’engager dans cette voie et cela independamment des elements evoques precedemment. A travers les entretiens individuels que nous avons conduits sur place, nous ont ete decrites des pratiques tres codifiees ou se melent les conceptions religieuses locales et la fierte d’appartenir a une identite, celles de l’ethnie Gurung. Notre etude montre comment des pratiques sociales et culturelles associees aux abeilles sauvages ou domestiques influencent l’apiculture locale ; et pourquoi les habitants s’appuient sur des connaissances et des pratiques qui sont celles de chasseurs-cueilleurs de miel et non celles d’eleveurs d’abeilles.

In the most classic reported interaction, ¡jats:italic¿Vespa velutina¡/jats:italic¿ may invade the nest of honeybees and kill many of workers. Although this interaction has been registered to Asian honeybees, which was shown how to defend the nests, little or no attention has been given to similar interactions in the Neotropical region. Here, we report for the first time an antagonistic interaction between the wasp ¡jats:italic¿Polybia ignobilis¡/jats:italic¿ and the stingless bees, ¡jats:italic¿Tetragonisca angustula¡/jats:italic¿. The wasp of this species was recorded killing and chewing guard bees near at the nest entrance of the stingless bee. Although our report is limited to answer evolutionary aspects of this interaction, it raises questions which may help to understand in the future the reasons this behavior evolved.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The human-wildlife conflict between beekeeping and wild birds is complicated, and further detailed studies are needed for a deeper understanding of the role and possible impact of predation by wild birds on honey production and bee colony health. Another potentially negative effect of birds on bees could be the dissemination of pathogens, such as Nosema ceranae. However, other important aspects of the complex relationship between bees and wild birds should be considered. First, honey bees have developed behavioural defences against the pressure of native predatory birds. Second, the ethology of some of these predators is fascinating like the interesting mutualistic relationship established between the so-called honeyguides and beekeepers. Finally, predatory birds could be important in the biocontrol of other bee enemies such as the invasive Asian hornet. Taking these additional aspects into consideration would provide a better insight into the conflict between wild animal conservation and human activity.¡/jats:p¿

T2  - The Journal of experimental biology
AB  - The ability of animals to learn and remember is an important adaptation for coping with environmental changes. The fitness benefits provided by these cognitive skills, in conjunction with social behaviours, contribute to the success of social insects. How these abilities are shared among the different castes and the long-term persistence of memory are now being elucidated in diverse systems, work that should shed light on general principles underlying cognitive evolution. Here, we provide the first evidence of olfactory learning and long-term olfactory memory in all three castes of an Asian hornet, Vespa velutina Using the first proboscis extension reflex assay developed for hornets or wasps, we found that all hornet castes could learn and remember odours associated with a food reward. Moreover, long-lasting memory was retained without significant decay in gynes (virgin queens) and drones even up to 30 days (workers did not survive for 30 days). Drones learned and remembered simple odorant molecules and gyne sex pheromone with equal facility. These results increase our understanding of the outstanding cognitive abilities of social insects and suggest the likely importance of long-lasting memory in different castes of the same species.

AB  - Honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is considered as an essential organism to the agricultural sector due to its role in pollination and alleviation of poverty in rural areas. Many pests attack honey bee colonies causing severe damages and economic losses. These pests include Varroa mites, Vespa hornets, wax moths, small hive beetles, and parasitic flies. Using chemical methods to control these pests causes some negative effects on honey bees and contaminates their products, while using biological control agents is promising and has no serious hazards. This article aimed to review available studies on the role of biological control agents mainly predators, parasitoids, and pathogens in controlling bee’s pests and to present new perspectives. Also, obstacles of using biocontrol agents inside and outside the hives were presented. This article is essential for planning integrated management programs for honey bee pests.

AB  - Eusocial Hymenoptera colonies are characterized by the presence of altruistic individuals, which rear their siblings instead of their own offspring. In the course of evolution, such sterile castes are thought to have emerged through the process of kin selection, altruistic traits being transmitted to following generation if they benefit relatives. By allowing kinship recognition, the detection of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) might be instrumental for kin selection. In carpenter ants, a female-specific olfactory subsystem processes CHC information through antennal detection by basiconic sensilla. It is still unclear if other families of eusocial Hymenoptera use the same subsystem for sensing CHCs. Here, we examined the existence of such a subsystem in Vespidae (using the hornet Vespa velutina), a family in which eusociality emerged independently of ants. The antennae of both males and female hornets contain large basiconic sensilla. Sensory neurons from the large basiconic sensilla exclusively project to a conspicuous cluster of small glomeruli in the antennal lobe, with anatomical and immunoreactive features that are strikingly similar to those of the ant CHC-sensitive subsystem. Extracellular electrophysiological recordings further show that sensory neurons within hornet basiconic sensilla preferentially respond to CHCs. Although this subsystem is not female-specific in hornets, the observed similarities with the olfactory system of ants are striking. They suggest that the basiconic sensilla subsystem could be an ancestral trait, which may have played a key role in the advent of eusociality in these hymenopteran families by allowing kin recognition and the production of altruistic behaviors toward relatives.

AB  - The Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana (IZSLT) and the International Federation of Beekeepers’ Associations (Apimondia) set up a worldwide survey in 2015–2017 to gather information on beekeepers’ perceptions concerning good beekeeping practices, the main honey bee diseases, and the technical assistance they receive. The on-line dissemination of the survey was facilitated by the “Technologies and Practices for Small Agricultural Producers” platform (TECA) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). In total, 248 questionnaires were received from the European region and the results are reported here. Varroosis remains the biggest concern and is the most important reason for beekeepers’ use of veterinary medicines. However, a sustainable approach to managing Varroa was detected. American foulbrood (AFB) and European foulbrood (EFB) infections are mainly managed through the shook swarm technique or burning the hives. Concerning technical assistance for disease management, beekeepers were mainly supported by their associations or expert beekeepers. Relevant data were collected and analyzed but information from many low-income countries in Africa or Asia is still missing, and more efforts are needed to fill the knowledge gaps.

AB  - ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ is an invasive species that is currently the main concern for beekeeping in some areas of northern Spain. The hornet hunts honeybees to feed its larvae, stressing and weakening the honeybee colonies. To avoid losses of honeybee colonies, it is essential to investigate the pressure that is exerted by the yellow-legged hornet on apiaries and its consequences. In the present study, hives were monitored in an apiary that was situated in a high-pressure area of ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ during the years 2020 and 2021. The monitoring of environmental conditions of the apiary, the internal conditions of the colonies, and a hunting camera were used to relate the presence of hornets in front of the hives to the weather conditions in the apiary and the consequences caused on the colonies. The relationships between weather conditions and the hornet's activity showed two types of hornet behavior. In the months of July and August, the maximum number of hornets appeared in non-central hours of the day. Meanwhile, in the months of September and October, the highest pressure in the apiary occurred in the central hours of the day, coinciding with temperatures between 15 °C and 25 °C and a relative humidity that was higher than 60

AB  - The northern giant hornet Vespa mandarinia (NGH) is a voracious predator of other insect species, including honey bees. NGH's native range spans subtropical and temperate regions across much of east and southeast Asia and, in 2019, exotic populations of the species were discovered in North America. Despite this broad range and invasive potential, investigation of the population genomic structure of NGH across its native and introduced ranges has thus far been limited to a small number of mitochondrial samples. Here, we present analyses of genomic data from NGH individuals collected across the species' native range and from exotic individuals collected in North America. We provide the first survey of whole-genome population variation for any hornet species, covering this species' native and invasive ranges, and in doing so confirm likely origins in Japan and South Korea for the two introductions. We additionally show that, while this introduced population exhibited strongly elevated levels of inbreeding, these signatures of inbreeding are also present in some long-standing native populations, which may indicate that inbreeding depression alone is insufficient to prevent the persistence of NGH populations. As well as highlighting the importance of ongoing monitoring and eradication efforts to limit the spread of this species outside of its natural range, our data will serve as a foundational database for future genomic studies into introduced hornet populations.

AB  - In colonial organisms, alarm pheromones can provide a key fitness advantage by enhancing colony defence and warning of danger. Learning which species use alarm pheromone and the key compounds involved therefore enhances our understanding of how this important signal has evolved. However, our knowledge of alarm pheromones is more limited in the social wasps and hornets compared with the social bees and ants. Vespa velutina is an economically important and widespread hornet predator that attacks honey bees and humans. This species is native to Asia and has now invaded Europe. Despite growing interest in V. velutina, it was unknown whether it possessed an alarm pheromone. We show that these hornets use sting venom as an alarm pheromone. Sting venom volatiles were strongly attractive to hornet workers and triggered attacks. Two major venom fractions, consisting of monoketones and diketones, also elicited attack. We used gas chromatography coupled to electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) to isolate 13 known and 3 unknown aliphatic ketones and alcohols in venom that elicited conspicuous hornet antennal activity. Two of the unknown compounds may be an undecen-2-one and an undecene-2,10-dinone. Three major compounds (heptan-2-one, nonan-2-one and undecan-2-one) triggered attacks, but only nonan-2-one did so at biologically relevant levels (10 hornet equivalents). Nonan-2-one thus deserves particular attention. However, the key alarm releasers for V. velutina remain to be identified. Such identification will help to illuminate the evolution and function of alarm compounds in hornets.

AB  - The invasive Asian hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) continues its spread across Europe, posing a significant threat to biodiversity, viticulture, and apiculture. This study reports the first molecular data of the invasive yellowlegged Asian hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) in Slovakia, confirmed through molecular analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Radio telemetry successfully located the nest within inaccessible private property, highlighting the technique's crucial role in early detection. This finding, along with the need for manual tracking techniques, public awareness campaigns, and regional monitoring programs, underscores the urgent need for proactive legal frameworks to facilitate the use of radio telemetry and ensure timely intervention to prevent further spread and mitigate the ecological and economic impacts of this invasive species in Slovakia and neighboring countries. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the importance of continued research and development of radio telemetry techniques, including improved signal range and integration with drone technology, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of V. velutina detection and control.

T2  - Insect Conservation and Diversity
AB  - The yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) has been identified as a major threat to European entomofauna. Species distribution models have been used to assess its invasiveness risk. No studies were, however, developed specifically for peripheral regions, where unique biodiversity can be threatened by this species. This study aims to address that particular issue by incorporating non-commonly used drivers and by forecasting regions in Iberian Peninsula where the species has high risk of expansion. Climatic, anthropogenic and land-use variables were considered. The species potential distribution was assessed using a generalised linear model. Overall, the model predicted the northern regions of the Iberian Peninsula suitable for the species expansion. Only the driest regions at the south are conservatively predicted to not be occupied by the yellow-legged hornet. Precipitation and temperature have the highest influence in Vespa velutina nigrithorax distribution, with land-use also playing an important role in its expansion at regional scale. These results highlighted the threat of this species to beekeeping activities. Due to high species richness and endemicity levels, peripheral regions integrated in Biodiversity Hotspots need special attention and control measures.

AB  - Bees play an essential role in plant pollination and their decline is a threat to crop yields and biodiversity sustainability. The causes of their decline have not yet been fully identified, despite the numerous studies that have been carried out, especially on Apis mellifera. This meta-analysis was conducted to identify gaps in the current research and new potential directions for research. The aim of this analysis of 293 international scientific papers was to achieve an inventory of the studied populations, the stressors and the methods used to study their impact on Apis mellifera. It also aimed to investigate the stressors with the greatest impact on bees and explore whether the evidence for an impact varies according to the type of study or the scale of study. According to this analysis, it is important to identify the populations and the critical developmental stages most at risk, and to determine the differences in stress sensibility between subspecies. This meta-analysis also showed that studies on climate change or habitat fragmentation were lacking. Moreover, it highlighted that technical difficulties in the field and the buffer effect of the colony represent methodological and biological barriers that are still difficult to overcome. Mathematical modeling or radio frequency identification (RFID) chips represent promising ways to overcome current methodological difficulties.

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - “One hundred worst” lists of alien species of the greatest concern proved useful for raising awareness of the risks and impacts of biological invasions amongst the general public, politicians and stakeholders. All lists so far have been based on expert opinion and primarily aimed at representativeness of the taxonomic and habitat diversity rather than at quantifying the harm the alien species cause. We used the generic impact scoring system (GISS) to rank 486 alien species established in Europe from a wide range of taxonomic groups to identify those with the highest environmental and socioeconomic impact. GISS assigns 12 categories of impact, each quantified on a scale from 0 (no impact detectable) to 5 (the highest impact possible). We ranked species by their total sum of scores and by the number of the highest impact scores. We also compared the listing based on GISS with other expert-based lists of the “worst” invaders. We propose a list of 149 alien species, comprising 54 plants, 49 invertebrates, 40 vertebrates and 6 fungi. Among the highest ranking species are one bird (Branta canadensis), four mammals (Rattus norvegicus, Ondatra zibethicus, Cervus nippon, Muntiacus reevesi), one crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), one mite (Varroa destructor), and four plants (Acacia dealbata, Lantana camara, Pueraria lobata, Eichhornia crassipes). In contrast to other existing expert-based “worst” lists, the GISS-based list given here highlights some alien species with high impacts that are not represented on any other list. The GISS provides an objective and transparent method to aid prioritization of alien species for management according to their impacts, applicable across taxa and habitats. Our ranking can also be used for justifying inclusion on lists such as the alien species of Union concern of the European Commission, and to fulfill Aichi target 9.

AU  - Xia, Xuhua
T2  - Life (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - The Asian hornet, ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿, is an invasive species that has not only expanded its range in Asia but has also invaded European countries, and it incurs significant costs on local apiculture. This phylogeographic study aims to trace the evolutionary trajectory of ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ and its close relatives; it aims to identify features that characterize an invasive species. The last successful invasion of ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ into France occurred in late May, 2002, and into South Korea in early October, 2002, which were estimated by fitting a logistic equation to the number of observations over time. The instantaneous rate of increase is 1.3667 for ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ in France and 0.2812 in South Korea, which are consistent with the interpretation of little competition in France and strong competition from local hornet species in South Korea. The invasive potential of two sister lineages can be compared by their distribution area when proper statistical adjustments are made to account for differences in sample size. ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ has a greater invasive potential than its sister lineage. The ancestor of ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ split into two lineages, one found in Indonesia/Malaysia and the other colonizing the Asian continent. The second lineage split into a sedentary clade inhabiting Pakistan and India and an invasive lineage colonizing much of Southeast Asia. This latter lineage gave rise to the subspecies ¡i¿V. v. nigrithorax¡/i¿, which invaded France, South Korea, and Japan. My software PGT version 1.5, which generates geophylogenies and computes geographic areas for individual taxa, is useful for understanding biogeography in general and invasive species in particular. I discussed the conceptual formulation of an index of invasiveness for a comparison between sister lineages.

TI  - The Asian wasp Vespa velutina nigrithorax: entomological and allergological characteristics
AU  - Vidal, Carmen
T2  - Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology
AB  - The yellow-legged or Asian wasp (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) has spread rapidly across Europe since its first introduction in France, in 2004. Originally from South-East Asia, it is considered an invasive species outside its native region. Apart from the ecological and economic implications of its presence, it may cause health problems to humans due to the toxic and allergenic components of its venom. Vespa velutina nigrithorax has become the most prevalent cause of anaphylaxis due to Hymenoptera venom in some regions of Spain. Although sIgE against both antigen 5 (Vesp v 5) and A1-phospholipase (Vesp v 1) has been detected in these patients, only Vesp v 5 may be considered a dominant allergen. Interestingly, Vesp v 1 appears to be a glycosylated allergen different from A1-phospholipases from other species. Inhibition studies suggest that Vespula spp venom could behave as primary sensitizer. Besides, changes in sIgE and sIgG4 during Vespula venom immunotherapy in patients with anaphylaxis due to V. velutina support the use of Vespula venom extracts to treat these patients. The purpose of this review is to explore the biological behaviour of V. velutina and to summarize the current knowledge of the allergic reactions provoked by this wasp.

It was predicted to contain 13 protein-coding, 20 tRNA, and two rRNA genes, along with one A + T-rich control region. The initiation codons ATC was found in one, ATG in four, ATT in five, and ATA in three genes, while TAA was the termination codon in all these genes. The average AT content of 13 protein-coding was 82

AB  - The yellow-legged Asian hornet is an invasive species of wasps, indigenous of the South-East Asia but quickly spreading in Southern Europe. Because of its exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honey bee colonies and to humans as well, restraint measures are under investigation. Among them, the harmonic radar described in (Ecology and Evolution, 6, 2016 and 2170) already proved to be a quite effective way to follow the hornets to their nests; it is in fact capable of tracking the flying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. The aforementioned harmonic radar was upgraded after a period of intense experimentation; the capture of the hornets was enhanced as well, and other improvements were adopted in the mounting procedure of the transponder. Thanks to these upgrades, the flying capabilities of the hornets were not reduced and a huge collection of data was recorded. The main upgrade to the radar was the adoption of the vertical polarization of the radiated field, with the consequent redesign and manufacturing of the antennas and the different mounting of the transceiver on the insect. The installation of the radar on a telescopic tower drastically improved the maneuverability of the system and the capability to follow the insects' preferential flying directions. Eventually, the system was able to produce much more continuous traces with a clear indication of the most probable position of the nest. The maximum range of detection was also increased to 150 m.

AB  - Honeybees face several predators and their ability to express collective defence behaviour is one of their major life traits that promote colony survival. We discovered that, while confronting attacks by the Oriental hornet Vespa orientalis, Apis mellifera cypria honeybees engage in a distinct acoustic behaviour: they produce a characteristic hissing sound of unexpectedly high frequency. When recording and analysing these hissing sounds during an extended sample of artificial attacks by hornets, we found that honeybees can produce sounds covering a wide frequency spectrum with a dominant frequency around 6 kHz. Notably, these acoustic emissions are distinct from the background noise of neighbouring flying bees. These results provide a detailed description of the sounds generated by A. m. cypria when defending their nest against hornets, and they could be used for future research to better understand the biological function of the acoustic behaviour in honeybees’ colony defence.

AB  - Insects appeared more than 400 million years ago and they represent the richest and most diverse taxonomic group with several million species. Yet, under the combined effect of the loss of natural habitats, the intensification of agriculture with massive use of pesticides, global warming and biological invasions, insects show alarming signs of decline. Although difficult to quantify, species extinction and population reductions are confirmed for many ecosystems. This results in a loss of services such as the pollination of plants, including food crops, the recycling of organic matter, the supply of goods such as honey and the stability of food webs. It is therefore urgent to halt the decline of Insects. We recommend implementing long-term monitoring of populations, tackling the causes of insect decline by reducing the use of synthetic insecticides, preserving natural habitats, and reinventing a positive relationship between humans and insects.

AU  - Tschacher, Wolfgang

T2  - Schizophrenia bulletin
AB  - In recent decades, embodiment has become an influential concept in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Embodiment denotes the study of the reciprocal (causal) relationships between mind and body, with the mind not only affecting the body but also vice versa. Embodied cognition comes to the fore in sensorimotor coupling, predictive coding, and nonverbal behavior. Additionally, the embodiment of the mind constitutes the basis of social interaction and communication, as evident in research on nonverbal synchrony and mimicry. These theoretical and empirical developments portend a range of implications for schizophrenia research and treatment. Sensorimotor dysfunctions are closely associated with affective and psychotic psychopathology, leading to altered timing in the processing of stimuli and to disordered appraisals of the environment. Problems of social cognition may be newly viewed as disordered embodied communication. The embodiment perspective suggests novel treatment strategies through psychotherapy and body-oriented interventions, and may ultimately provide biomarkers for diagnosis.

AB  - ¡i¿Vespa crabro¡/i¿, also known as European hornet, is a eusocial Vespidae originally from Eurasia that was accidentally introduced on the island of Sardinia (Italy) in 2010. Currently, its distribution is limited to the northern area of the island. Considering that a non-harmful species in its native region can exhibit invasive behaviour when established in new environments, bio-ethological observations were conducted to better understand whether ¡i¿V. crabro¡/i¿ could show invasive traits in Sardinia, which represents a new introduction area. Data on the foraging activity of the European hornet in open fields were collected within a citizen science monitoring program carried out in Sardinia from 2018 to 2020. Moreover, specific behavioural observations were made in apiaries to assess the predatory activity of the hornet towards honey bees and at the entrance of free-living European hornet colonies to evaluate other aspects of its behaviour, i.e., intranidal and extranidal tasks. The results of our study are discussed in relation to the behavioural traits known for this species in its native areas to place the behavioural repertoire of ¡i¿V. crabro¡/i¿ in Sardinia into a wider context. Our observations revealed that ¡i¿V. crabro¡/i¿ did not show any changes in behavioural traits in Sardinia compared to those described in its area of origin, so the risk of becoming an invasive species on this island seems unlikely.

T2  - Cell reports
AB  - Summary Research on honeybee memory has led to a widely accepted model in which a single pairing of an odor stimulus with sucrose induces memories that are independent of protein synthesis but is unable to form protein-synthesis-dependent long-term memory (LTM). The latter is said to arise only after three or more pairings of odor and sucrose. Here, we show that this model underestimates the capacity of the bee brain to form LTMs after a unique appetitive experience. Using state-of-the art conditioning setups and individual-based analyses of conditioned responses, we found that protein-synthesis-dependent memories are formed already 4 h after the single conditioning trial and persist even 3 days later. These memories (4 h, 24 h, and 72 h) exhibit different dependencies on transcription and translation processes. Our results thus modify the traditional view of one-trial memories in an insect with a model status for memory research.

TI  - Outcome of the public consultation on the draft EFSA Scientific Committee Opinion on a systems‐based approach to the environmental risk assessment of multiple stressors in honey bees
T2  - EFSA Supporting Publications
AB  - The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) carried out a public consultation to receive input from interested parties on the draft scientific opinion on a systems-based approach to the environmental risk assessment of multiple stressors in honey bees. This draft scientific opinion was prepared by the EFSA Scientific Committee, supported by a Working Group on the development of a holistic and integrated approach to the environmental risk assessment of multiple stressors in bees. The draft opinion was endorsed by the EFSA Scientific Committee for public consultation on 11 November 2020. The written public consultation was open from 07 January 2021 until 04 March 2021. EFSA received comments from 17 different interested parties. EFSA and its Scientific Committee wish to thank all stakeholders for their contributions to this work. The present report contains the comments received and details how they have been considered for the finalisation of the opinion. The final opinion was adopted at the Scientific Committee Plenary meeting on 14 April 2021 and will be published in the EFSA Journal.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - The German yellowjacket (Vespula germanica) is an opportunist predator and a scavenger, whose eclectic diet also includes honey, brood, dead and live honey-bees. There is no evidence in this species of coordinated attacks against bees involving other conspecifics, although intraspecific competition has been already reported between two or more individuals during feeding. Our aim was to gain further knowledge on the feeding behavior of V. germanica in order to evaluate its role in an apiary. Sight observations of predation and necrophagy behaviors were carried out at the ground level near hives. We also investigated how intraspecific competition can influence the feeding display in this species. Our results confirm the major role of the German yellowjacket as a scavenger, because its diet is based mostly on bee carrions. Intraspecific competition during feeding was sometimes observed. When these events occurred, the interference of another wasp led to the bee escaping only in three cases. Our study also revealed that intraspecific competition events increase when the resource is fresh (predation vs necrophagy), and that the number of competing wasps was significantly higher when the food consisted of pupae and drones, compared to adult bees. When competition involved two individuals (the most frequent case), the winner was frequently the first wasp to reach the resource in both predation and necrophagy events. This suggests that the energy invested in foraging or predating activity and in defence of prey is usually rewarded.

T2  - BioRisk : biodiversity & ecosystem risk assessment
AB  - Th is chapter reviews the eff ects of alien terrestrial arthropods on the economy, society and environment in Europe. Many alien insect and mite species cause serious socio-economic hazards as pests of agriculture, horticulture, stored products and forestry. Th ey may also aff ect human or animal health. Surprisingly, there is relatively little information available on the exact yield and fi nancial losses due to alien agricultural and forestry pests in Europe, particularly at continental scale. Several alien species may have a positive impact on the economy, for example parasitoids and predators introduced for the biological control of important pests. Invasive alien arthropods can also cause environmental hazards. Th ey may aff ect native biodiversity through various mechanisms, including herbivory, predation, parasitism, competition for resource and space, or as vectors of diseases. Th ey can also aff ect ecosystem services and processes through cascading eff ects. However, these ecological impacts are poorly studied, particularly in Europe, where only a handful cases have been reported.

AB  - This dataset result from the large-scale citizen science program aiming at accurately mapping the distribution of V. velutina in apiaries across France and Germany. Overall, a total of 1697 responses from beekeepers on the presence or absence of V. velutina predating in the apiaries across France (n=1368 responses) and Germany (n=329 responses). The responses were widely distributed throughout France and Germany. The hornet was established throughout the French territory as expected, and mostly detected near the French border in Germany. We found that HBR was substantially lower in Germany than in France. Temperature had a positive effect on both the hornet presence and HBR whereas the distance to the introduction point had a negative effect, both in France and Germany. These results suggest that the expansion of V. velutina in Western Europe could be reduced on the eastern front due to continental climate. The spatial variability in HBR suggests that the impact of V. velutina on beekeeping is not homogenous throughout the invasion range, in particular in Germany. Considering HBR spatial variability could help formulating regionally adapted management plans to limit V. velutina impacts on biodiversity, human health and economic sectors.

AB  - Over the last 30 years, harmonic radars have been effective only in tracking insects flying at low altitude and over flat terrain. We developed an innovative harmonic radar, implementing the most advanced radar techniques, which covers a large field of view in elevation (with an angular aperture of about 24°) and can track insects up to a range of 500 m. We show all the components of this new harmonic radar and its first application, the tracking of Vespa velutina (yellow-legged Asian hornet). This is an invasive species which, although indigenous to South-East Asia, is spreading quickly to other regions of the world. Because of its fast diffusion and the serious threat it poses to both honeybee colonies and to humans, control measures are mandatory. When equipped with a small passive transponder, this radar system can track the flight trajectory of insects and locate nests to be destroyed. This tool has potential not only for monitoring V. velutina but also for tracking other larger insects and small size vertebrates.

AB  - We genetically identified three different species of hornets and analyzed the nutrient compositions of their edible brood. Samples were collected from a commercial production unit in Shizong province of China and from forests near Andong City in Korea. The species were identified as Vespa velutina, V. mandarinia, and V. basalis from China and V. velutina from Korea. Farmed V. velutina and V. mandarinia were found to have similar protein contents, i.e., total amino acids, whereas V. basalis contained less protein. The V. velutina brood collected from the forest contained the highest amount of amino acids. Altogether 17 proteinogenic amino acids were detected and quantified with similar patterns of distribution in all three species: leucine followed by tyrosine and lysine being predominant among the essential and glutamic acid among the non-essential amino acids. A different pattern was found for fatty acids: The polyunsaturated fatty acid proportion was highest in V. mandarinia and V. basalis, but saturated fatty acids dominated in the case of V. velutina from two different sources. The high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids in the lipids of the hornets could be expected to exhibit nutritional benefits, including reducing cardiovascular disorders and inflammations. High minerals contents, especially micro minerals such as iron, zinc, and a high K/Na ratio in hornets could help mitigate mineral deficiencies among those of the population with inadequate nutrition.

T2  - Viruses
AB  - The Asian yellow-legged hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax, a major predator of honeybees, is spreading in Europe in part due to a lack of efficient control methods. In this study, as a first step to identify biological control agents, we characterized viral RNA sequences present in asymptomatic or symptomatic hornets. Among 19 detected viruses, the honey bee virus Deformed wing virus-B was predominant in all the samples, particularly in muscles from the symptomatic hornet, suggesting a putative cause of the deformed wing symptom. Interestingly, two new viruses closely related to Acyrthosiphon pisum virus and Himetobi P virus and viruses typically associated with honey bees, Acute bee paralysis virus and Black queen cell virus, were detected in the brain and muscles, and may correspond to the circulation and possible replication forms of these viruses in the hornet. Aphid lethal paralysis virus, Bee Macula-like virus, and Moku virus, which are known to infect honey bees, were also identified in the gut virus metagenome of hornets. Therefore, our study underlined the urgent need to study the host range of these newly discovered viruses in hornets to determine whether they represent a new threat for honey bees or a hope for the biocontrol of V. velutina.

AB  - Vespa velutina is an invasive hornet that is colonising several countries worldwide, with detrimental effects on multiple components but primarily affecting honey bees and native insect species. Traps for wasps and hornets are commonly used for trapping V. velutina, both for monitoring and control purposes. In this study, we compared the performances of two typologies of traps and baits widely used for trapping this invasive hornet, by evaluating their effectiveness and selectiveness in trapping V. velutina in two sites during two different periods of the year, spring and autumn. The performance of the traps changed in relation to (i) the trap’s model, (ii) the bait’s typology and (iii) the period of the year. In spring, traps with common beer as bait were more effective and more selective independently of trap’s model than the commercial bait that has been tested. On the contrary, in autumn, just one combination of trap and attractant (the commercial trap and bait) achieved higher effectiveness and selectiveness. Despite the underlined variations among traps and baits, overall catches of V. velutina were scanty compared to bycatches of non-target insects, since best performing traps either in term of effectiveness and selectiveness caught 3.65

AB  - The emergence of resistance to chemical drugs in beekeeping is becoming a phenomenon of widespread concern. One promising alternative to the use of chemicals is entomopathogenic organisms that are environmentally friendly and are capable of stopping the expression of resistance once it has evolved. In the recent past, the scientific community has carried out several experiments addressing the use of microbiological control agents. In particular, experimental studies using entomopathogenic fungi have had more success in honey bee research. With their adherence properties and their ability to digest the cuticle and overcome the host defense mechanism, they could be a suitable ingredient in bioacaricides. Several promising fungi have been identified in the search for effective means to control pest populations. The data obtained from the different experiments are interesting and often favorable to their use, but there are also conflicting results. The aim of this review is to describe the state of the art on the topic under investigation.

AB  - Vespa velutina, also known as the Asian hornet, is considered as an invasive species out of its native zone. In particular, since it preys on honey bees, its recent progression in Europe could soon pose a significant risk to the local apiculture activity. European beekeepers are therefore investigating adapted control strategies, including V. velutina nest destruction. Unfortunately, nest location pinpointing generally follows a manual process which can prove tedious, time-consuming and inaccurate. In this article, we propose the use of a network of micro aerial vehicles featuring autonomous and cooperative flight capabilities. We describe an adapted controlled mobility strategy and detail the design of our Virtual Force Protocol (VFP) which allows a swarm of vehicles to track and follow hornets to their nests, while maintaining connectivity through a wireless multi-hop communication route with a remote ground station used to store applicative data such as hornet trajectory and vehicle telemetry. In order to achieve the mission objectives with a minimum of vehicles, we identify through simulations appropriate value for the key parameters of VFP and discuss the obtained network performance.

T2  - Applied Ecology and Environmental Research
AB  - Pathogenic organisms such as viruses can infect multiple host species from different trophic levels. Honeybee, A. mellifera is naturally infected by many viruses. Understanding the mechanism underlying virus spread in honeybee colonies highly depends on the pathogenic ability of honeybee killing viruses in other insects such as ants, Messor concolor (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). The purpose of this study was to investigate the existence and prevalence of two significant viruses, deformed wing virus (DWV) and black queen cell virus (BQCV) of honeybees in ants from the nests around different honeybee apiaries in Southeast Turkey by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both viruses were present in two nests while the former existed in another hive. Some ant nests were uninfected. This study is the first to report the molecular detection of the honeybee infecting DWV and BQCV in ants. Further studies should be devoted to the mechanisms underlying virus spread between honeybee and other interacting insects especially the Hymenopterans.

Some contributions deal with questions of acceptability and legality, others tackle problems related to innovative techniques in processing and marketing food, and yet another group of papers highlights the use of insects and their bio-active products in the context of promoting human health. The collective aim of the contributions by the researchers from at least 20 countries is to examine whether the use of insects-be it for food, feed, or therapeutic purposes-has a future. We conclude that positive aspects undoubtedly exist regarding the nutritional and pharmacological value of various insect species but that environmental and bio-functional issues could even outweigh the nutritional value of food insects.

AB  - Various viruses can infect honey bees, but deformed wing virus (DWV) is considered the most dangerous virus to them and has role in the sudden decline of bee colonies. This virus has different strains; however, there are no available studies to compare the characteristics of these strains utilizing bioinformatics. In this study, 27 strains of deformed wing virus were analyzed based on their sequences and their genetic relationships. Also, some primers were designed and tested to identify their ability to separate DWV strains. The percentages range from 28.99

AB  - Many bees, butterflies, birds, bats and primates are known to forage on familiar plant resources by visiting them in a stable and repeatable order called "traplines". Here we report the existence of trapline foraging in wasps, the Japanese yellow hornets. We monitored the movement patterns of wild individually marked hornets collecting sucrose solution on four artificial flowers placed in their home range. After thirty consecutive foraging bouts, all the hornets had developed a repeatable flower visitation sequence. Using two different arrays of flowers, we also show that hornets consistently increased their foraging efficiency with experience. However, they did not always use the shortest path to visit all the flowers, often favoring movements between nearest-neighbour options rather than minimizing overall travel distance. Our study thus adds nectar-foraging wasps to the list of animals that exhibit trapline foraging, thereby significantly broadening the scope for comparative research in multi-destination route learning and memory.

AU  - Zhu, Gengping

AB  - Abstract The Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia) is the world’s largest hornet. It is native to East Asia, but was recently detected in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington State, USA. Vespa mandarinia are an invasion concern due to their potential to negatively affect honey bees and act as a human nuisance pest. Here, we assessed effects of bioclimatic variables on V. mandarinia and used ensemble forecasts to predict habitat suitability for this pest globally. We also simulated potential dispersal of V. mandarinia in western North America. We show that V. mandarinia are most likely to invade areas with warm to cool annual mean temperature but high precipitation, and could be particularly problematic in regions with these conditions and high levels of human activity. We identified regions with suitable habitat on all six continents except Antarctica. The realized niche of introduced populations in the USA and Canada was small compared to native populations, implying high potential for invasive spread into new regions. Dispersal simulations showed that without containment, V. mandarinia could rapidly spread into southern Washington and Oregon, USA and northward through British Columbia, Canada. Given its potential negative impacts, and the capacity for spread within northwestern North America and worldwide, strong mitigation efforts are needed to prevent further spread of V. mandarinia.

AB  - Domestic and captive animals and cultivated plants should be recognised as integral components in contemporary ecosystems. They interact with wild organisms through such mechanisms as hybridization, predation, herbivory, competition and disease transmission and, in many cases, define ecosystem properties. Nevertheless, it is widespread practice for data on domestic, captive and cultivated organisms to be excluded from biodiversity repositories, such as natural history collections. Furthermore, there is a lack of integration of data collected about biodiversity in disciplines, such as agriculture, veterinary science, epidemiology and invasion science. Discipline-specific data are often intentionally excluded from integrative databases in order to maintain the "purity" of data on natural processes. Rather than being beneficial, we argue that this practise of data exclusivity greatly limits the utility of discipline-specific data for applications ranging from agricultural pest management to invasion biology, infectious disease prevention and community ecology. This problem can be resolved by data providers using standards to indicate whether the observed organism is of wild or domestic origin and by integrating their data with other biodiversity data (e.g. in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility). Doing so will enable efforts to integrate the full panorama of biodiversity knowledge across related disciplines to tackle pressing societal questions.

End 2016, Moku virus was reported in Asian hornets from the same area. In addition, the Moku virus was already present in historical samples of bees collected in 2013, that is, 2 years after the official first detection of Asian hornets in the same area of Belgium. This study suggests a spread of Moku virus to honey bees with possible consequences.

AB  - Honey bees are essential to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. However, despite no single factor being blamed for losses of honey bee colonies in Europe and the USA, viruses have been considered as a major driver. Moreover, a virus vector can enhance the titer and virulence of virus such as Varroa destructor can change the virulence of the deformed wing virus. Here, we report molecular evidence for aphid lethal paralysis virus (ALPV) infecting Vespa velutina, which is an important predator of honey bees, especially of Apis cerana. Viral replication and phylogenetic analysis indicated that ALPV can not only replicate in V. velutina and A. cerana, but ALPV from A. cerana (ALPV-Ac) was also significantly associated with that of V. velutina (ALPV-Vv), though distinct from those of Apis mellifera (ALPV-Am). The host state posterior probability displayed that V. velutina is the main viral reservoir between V. velutina and A. cerana. Our results show ALPV had expanded host diversity resulting in potential impacts on the health of pollinators, even on the pollination ecosystem. We suggest further studies should investigate potential risks and impacts on pollinator populations of hornets. These results should have an impact conservation efforts focused on sustaining native pollinator abundance and diversity, and therefore, the crucial ecosystem services that they provide.

TI  - Mycosphere Essay 19. Cordyceps species parasitizing hymenopteran and hemipteran insects
AU  - Shrestha, Bhushan
T2  - Mycosphere : journal of fungal biology
AB  - Hymenoptera and Hemiptera are two major insect orders after Coleoptera and Lepidoptera that are parasitized by Cordyceps species. Among the 52 Cordyceps species parasitizing hymenopterans, the majority (50 species) are recorded on suborder Apocrita (ants, bees, wasps). Ant family Formicidae is the mostly parasitized family followed by Vespidae (wasps). Ophiocordyceps uilateralis, O. sphececephala, O. myrmecophila and Cordyceps australis are some of the cosmopolitan species that parasitize ants and wasps. Among Cordyceps species recorded on hemipterans, the majority (34 species) are recorded on suborder Auchenorrhyncha (cicadas, spittlebugs, froghoppers), followed by six species on suborder sternorhyncha (scale insects) and four species on the suborder Heteroptera (true bugs). Ophiocordyceps nutans is recorded worldwide in Asia, Africa and South America and parasitizes more than 30 species of true bugs. Another worldwide species is Ophiocordyceps sobolifera that parasitizes six cicada species in Asia, Africa and South America. Pentatomidae (true bugs), Cicadidae (cicadas) and Acanthosomatidae (shield bugs) are major host families within Hemiptera. Cordyceps species parasitizing hemipteran insects are phylogenetically very diverse and are currently segregated into Metarhizium, Ophiocordyceps, Polycephalomyces, Purpureocillium and Tolypocladium. Many hymenopterans and hemipterans are important insect pests and have invaded new localities in the world, threatening agriculture and human life. The host information compiled in this review could be informative for their use as potential biocontrol agents of endemic insect pests belonging to Hymenoptera and Hemiptera, including invasive alien species.

AB  - The aim of the research was to determine the influence of acetamiprid and deltamethrin on the mortality and behaviour of honeybees of the same variety, coming from the same source and estimated to be in good condition by a professional beekeeper, but in different years and under different weather conditions. Results of research conducted in field isolators in oilseed rape fields in the years 2012–2018 showed no acetamiprid influence either on the mortality or on the behaviour of honeybees. Deltamethrin activity differed from a lack of influence through causing mortality and a weaker condition of honeybee colonies to the destruction of the colony. This demonstrates the relative safety of acetamiprid to honeybees and the high risk of deltamethrin use. The differences in the bee colonies’ reaction to deltamethrin are probably caused by the high acute toxicity of this active ingredient, genetically dependent, variable metabolic capabilities of particular bee colonies, or coexistence of a variety of different stressors—mainly pathogens.

AB  - Vespa velutina is an invasive hornet species that is colonising Europe, generating considerable impacts on honeybees, beekeeping and biodiversity. Control and early warning strategies for this species are mainly based on monitoring plans and procedures of nest detection and destruction. Technological tools (harmonic radar, radio-telemetry) have been developed to increase the probabilities of nest detection in new outbreaks. Since hornets are able to regulate nest temperature, thermography may represent an additional technique that may be used, both alone or in support to other techniques. In this study, the viability of thermal imaging in detecting nests of V. velutina was evaluated in controlled conditions. The influence of different environmental and operative variables (time of the day, presence/absence of leaves covering the nest, distance between the nest and the operator) were tested on three nests detected during August 2018 in Italy. All the nests were detectable by thermal imaging, but environmental and operative variables affect their detectability. The temperature difference between the nests and the surrounding reaches its maximum before sunrise and without a tree canopy covering the nests. Although nests were visible in some cases from 30 m, the detectability was higher at shorter distances, even if this variable may also depend on infrared camera resolution. An increase in the environmental temperature also generates a decrease of nest detectability. Although some limitations could occur, these results show the applicability of thermography in detecting V. velutina nests before the beginning of the reproductive phase, and consequently its potentiality in control strategies.

T2  - Diversity
AB  - ¡jats:p¿The current challenge for the development of beekeeping is the possibility of bee pests invading new areas. It is well known that each geographical range has its unique pest species. The fly Megaselia scalaris is a facultative parasitoid to honey bees. This fly has been recorded in various countries while information about it in Saudi Arabia is still seldom. The main objective of this study was to follow the spread of this fly from North Africa/South Europe towards Gulf countries utilizing ecological modeling. Maxent, as a specialist software in analyzing species distribution, was used in combination of five environmental factors. The analysis was performed to cover current and future conditions (2050). The outputs of the model were analyzed in regard to their performance and distribution of M. scalaris in the study area. The top factor contributing to the model was the annual mean temperature with a percentage of 56.3. The model maps emphasized the possible occurrence of this pest in the northern parts of Saudi Arabia. The wide establishment and distribution towards the central and southern parts of Saudi Arabia were not supported. Screening apiaries located in Northern areas in Saudi Arabia for the presence of this pest using specific bait traps could be a good recommendation from this study.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - Concern is growing over the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides, which can impair honey bee cognition. We provide the first demonstration that sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid can harm honey bee decision-making about danger by significantly increasing the probability of a bee visiting a dangerous food source. Apis cerana is a native bee that is an important pollinator of agricultural crops and native plants in Asia. When foraging on nectar containing 40 µg/L (34 ppb) imidacloprid, honey bees (Apis cerana) showed no aversion to a feeder with a hornet predator, and 1.8 fold more bees chose the dangerous feeder as compared to control bees. Control bees exhibited significant predator avoidance. We also give the first evidence that foraging by A. cerana workers can be inhibited by sublethal concentrations of the pesticide, imidacloprid, which is widely used in Asia. Compared to bees collecting uncontaminated nectar, 23

AB  - Andrena camellia, an effective pollinator of the economicallysignificant crop Camellia oleifera, can withstand the toxic pollen of C. oleifera, making A. camellia a crucial for resource conservation and cultivation of C. oleifera. In this study, the whole genome of A. camellia was sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore platform. The assembled genome size was 340.73 Mb including 50 scaffolds (N50=47.435 Mb) and 131 contigs (N50=17.2 Mb). A total of 11, 258 protein-coding genes were annotated, in addition, 1,104 non-coding RNAs were identified. Further analysis that some chromosomes of A. camellia have a high level of synteny with those of Apis mellifera, Osmia bicornis and Andrena minutula. Thus, our reported genome of A. camellia serves as a valuable resource for studying species evolution, behavioral biology, and adaption to toxic pollen of C. oleifera.

TI  - Monitoring of honey bee colony losses: a special issue
AU  - Gregorc, Aleš
T2  - Diversity
AB  - In recent decades, independent national and international research programs have revealed possible reasons for the death of managed honey bee colonies worldwide. Such losses are not due to a single factor, but instead are due to highly complex interactions between various internal and external influences, including pests, pathogens, honey bee stock diversity, and environmental change. Reduced honey bee vitality and nutrition, exposure to agrochemicals, and quality of colony management contribute to reduced colony survival in beekeeping operations. Our Special Issue (SI) on ‘’Monitoring of Honey Bee Colony Losses’’ aims to address specific challenges facing honey bee researchers and beekeepers. This SI includes four reviews, with one being a meta-analysis that identifies gaps in the current and future directions for research into honey bee colonies mortalities. Other review articles include studies regarding the impact of numerous factors on honey bee mortality, including external abiotic factors (e.g., winter conditions and colony management) as well as biotic factors such as attacks by Vespa velutina and Varroa destructor.

T2  - Frontiers in veterinary science
AB  - Approximately one-third of the typical human Western diet depends upon pollination for production, and honey bees (Apis mellifera) are the primary pollinators of numerous food crops, including fruits, nuts, vegetables, and oilseeds. Regional large scale losses of managed honey bee populations have increased significantly during the last decade. In particular, asymptomatic infection of honey bees with viruses and bacterial pathogens are quite common, and co-pathogenic interaction with other pathogens have led to more severe and frequent colony losses. Other multiple environmental stress factors, including agrochemical exposure, lack of quality forage, and reduced habitat, have all contributed to the considerable negative impact upon bee health. The ability to accurately diagnose diseases early could likely lead to better management and treatment strategies. While many molecular diagnostic tests such as real-time PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry have been developed to detect honey bee pathogens, they are not field-deployable and thus cannot support local apiary husbandry decision-making for disease control. Here we review the field-deployable technology termed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and its application to diagnose honey bee infections.

AB  - In the past centuries, viruses have benefited from globalization to spread across the globe, infecting new host species and populations. A growing number of viruses have been documented in the western honey bee, Apis mellifera. Several of these contribute significantly to honey bee colony losses. This review synthetizes the knowledge of the diversity and distribution of honey-bee-infecting viruses, including recent data from high-throughput sequencing (HTS). After presenting the diversity of viruses and their corresponding symptoms, we surveyed the scientific literature for the prevalence of these pathogens across the globe. The geographical distribution shows that the most prevalent viruses (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus, black queen cell virus and acute paralysis complex) are also the most widely distributed. We discuss the ecological drivers that influence the distribution of these pathogens in worldwide honey bee populations. Besides the natural transmission routes and the resulting temporal dynamics, global trade contributes to their dissemination. As recent evidence shows that these viruses are often multihost pathogens, their spread is a risk for both the beekeeping industry and the pollination services provided by managed and wild pollinators.

AB  - Tools are provided to assess the health status of managed honeybee colonies by facilitating further harmonisation of data collection and reporting, design of field surveys across the European Union (EU) and analysis of data on bee health. The toolbox is based on characteristics of a healthy managed honeybee colony: an adequate size, demographic structure and behaviour; an adequate production of bee products (both in relation to the annual life cycle of the colony and the geographical location); and provision of pollination services. The attributes ‘queen presence and performance’, ‘demography of the colony’, ‘in-hive products’ and ‘disease, infection and infestation’ could be directly measured in field conditions across the EU, whereas ‘behaviour and physiology’ is mainly assessed through experimental studies. Analysing the resource providing unit, in particular land cover/use, of a honeybee colony is very important when assessing its health status, but tools are currently lacking that could be used at apiary level in field surveys across the EU. Data on ‘beekeeping management practices’ and ‘environmental drivers’ can be collected via questionnaires and available databases, respectively. The capacity to provide pollination services is regarded as an indication of a healthy colony, but it is assessed only in relation to the provision of honey because technical limitations hamper the assessment of pollination as regulating service (e.g. to pollinate wild plants) in field surveys across the EU. Integrating multiple attributes of honeybee health, for instance, via a Health Status Index, is required to support a holistic assessment. Examples are provided on how the toolbox could be used by different stakeholders. Continued interaction between the Member State organisations, the EU Reference Laboratory and EFSA is required to further validate methods and facilitate the efficient use of precise and accurate bee health data that are collected by many initiatives throughout the EU.

T2  - Trends in Entomology
AB  - Vespidae represents a large and diverse family and comprises both social and solitary wasps that occupy a large array of habitats. Though some are considered nuisance insects, many of the species are also known as insect predators and pollinators. An additional role of select vespid wasps, originally elucidated approximately 30 years ago and gaining in the number of identified wasps, is dispersal of plant reproductive organs (vespicochory). This relationship is considered mutualistic given the long-range dispersal benefit to the diaspore, and the nutritional benefit to the wasps. Long-chain hydrocarbons have been shown to be responsible for attracting wasps to the organs of some diaspores. Recent observations in northern California indicated that yellowjackets (Vespula spp.), particularly western yellowjacket, Vespula pensylvanica, procured and transported diaspores (achenes) from the western spicebush (Calycanthus occidentalis), a riparian shrub endemic to California. Volatile profile analyses of C. occidentalis achenes showed emission of a diverse range of volatile classes. Empirical electrophysiological and trapping studies suggest a composite of odors may stimulate wasp attractancy to the achene.

AB  - Twenty-two pesticides and veterinary drugs of which residues were detected in beeswax in Europe were selected according to different criteria. The risk to honey bee health posed by the presence of these residues in wax was assessed based on three exposure scenarios. The first one corresponds to the exposure of larvae following their close contact with wax constituting the cells in which they develop. The second one corresponds to the exposure of larvae following consumption of the larval food that was contaminated from contact with contaminated wax. The third one corresponds to the exposure of adult honey bees following wax chewing when building cells and based on a theoretical worst-case scenario (= intake of contaminants from wax). Following these three scenarios, maximum concentrations which should not be exceeded in beeswax in order to protect honey bee health were calculated for each selected substance. Based on these values, provisional action limits were proposed. Beeswax exceeding these limits should not be put on the market.

AB  - Although monandry is believed to have facilitated the evolution of eusociality, many highly eusocial insects have since evolved extreme polyandry. The transition to extreme polyandry was likely driven by the benefits of within-colony genetic variance to task specialization and/or disease resistance, but the extent to which it confers secondary benefits, once evolved, is unclear. Here we investigate the consequences of extreme polyandry on the invasive potential of the Asian honey bee, Apis cerana. In honey bees and other Hymenoptera, small newly founded invasive populations must overcome the genetic constraint of their sex determination system that requires heterozygosity at a sex-determining locus to produce viable females. We find A. cerana queens in an invasive population mate with an average of 27 males (range 16-42) that would result in the founding queen/s carrying 75

AB  - Europe is pursuing its ambition for a climate-neutral, sustainable future. The European Commission's Green Deal, an important step in this direction, has at its heart the protection of the European Union (EU)'s biodiversity and the resilience of its ecosystems. Reducing the use and risk of pesticides and reversing the decline of pollinators are but two of the 'calls-to-action' embedded, respectively, in the Green Deal's Farm to Fork and Biodiversity Strategies. Much of the science supporting policymakers on these highly complex bodies of work falls within the remit of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). EFSA scientists are working to help address these challenges, as reflected in the release in 2021 of two important scientific reports. The first report addresses a mandate from the European Commission for a review of the 2013 bee guidance document on the risk assessment of pesticides in relation to honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees; the second responds to the European Parliament's request for a scientific opinion on the development of an integrated and holistic approach for the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of multiple stressors in managed honey bees (Apis mellifera)known as the MUST-B project.

AB  - Parasitoid wasps are fundamental insects for the biological control of agricultural pests. Despite the importance of wasps as natural enemies for more sustainable and healthy agriculture, the factors that could impact their species richness, abundance, and fitness, such as viral diseases, remain almost unexplored. Parasitoid wasps have been studied with regard to the endogenization of viral elements and the transmission of endogenous viral proteins that facilitate parasitism. However, circulating viruses are poorly characterized. Here, RNA viromes of six parasitoid wasp species are studied using public libraries of next-generation sequencing through an integrative bioinformatics pipeline. Our analyses led to the identification of 18 viruses classified into 10 families (¡i¿Iflaviridae, Endornaviridae, Mitoviridae, Partitiviridae, Virgaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Chuviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Xinmoviridae,¡/i¿ and ¡i¿Narnaviridae¡/i¿) and into the ¡i¿Bunyavirales¡/i¿ order. Of these, 16 elements were described for the first time. We also found a known virus previously identified on a wasp prey which suggests viral transmission between the insects. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of virus surveillance in wasps as its service disruption can affect ecology, agriculture and pest management, impacting the economy and threatening human food security.

AB  - ¡jats:sec¿ ¡jats:title¿Abstract¡/jats:title¿ ¡jats:p¿Understanding and assessing the capacity for learning, memory, and cognition in non-model organisms is a growing field. In invertebrate cognition, eusocial hymenopteran species such as honeybees, bumblebees, and ants are well-studied for their learning and memory abilities due to decades of research providing well-tested methods of training and assessing cognition. In the current study, we assess the use of different conditioning methods on visual learning in a non-model hymenopteran species which is becoming increasingly used in learning and memory tasks, the European wasp (¡jats:italic¿Vespula vulgaris¡/jats:italic¿). We trained individual wasps to learn to discriminate between perceptually similar colours using absolute conditioning (reward on target stimulus in the absence of distractors), appetitive differential conditioning (reward on target stimulus and no outcome for incorrect stimulus), or appetitive-aversive differential conditioning (reward on target stimulus and aversive outcome for incorrect stimulus). When trained with absolute conditioning, wasps were unable to learn to discriminate between perceptually similar colours. However, when trained with appetitive differential conditioning or appetitive-aversive differential conditioning, wasps were able to learn to discriminate between two similar colours, although they performed best when an aversive reinforcement was provided during training. Our results show similarities to learning behaviour in honeybees and bumblebees, and provide insight into the learning and cognition of a non-model invertebrate. Our findings provide important comparative data to aid in understanding the evolution of learning and memory in hymenopterans.¡/jats:p¿ ¡/jats:sec¿¡jats:sec¿ ¡jats:title¿Significance statement¡/jats:title¿ ¡jats:p¿Foraging insects such as bees, ants, and wasps visit a variety of food sources such as flowers, insect prey, and rotting fruit. Many of these insects must learn and recall resource traits such as location, scent, shape, colour, and size. To understand the process of learning in insects which are comparatively less studied than those such as honeybees and bumblebees, we trained wasps to discriminate between two similar colours using three different types of conditioning methods. Wasps were best able to learn to discriminate between the similar colours when trained with appetitive-aversive differential conditioning, where a reward is provided for a correct choice and an aversive outcome was providing for an incorrect choice. Our results show that similar to popular invertebrate cognition models, wasp learning is improved when an aversive outcome is introduced for incorrect choices.¡/jats:p¿ ¡/jats:sec¿

AB  - Sentinel sites, where problems can be identified early or investigated in detail, form an important part of planning for exotic disease outbreaks in humans, livestock and plants. Key questions are: how many sentinels are required, where should they be positioned and how effective are they at rapidly identifying new invasions? The sentinel apiary system for invasive honeybee pests and diseases illustrates the costs and benefits of such approaches. Here, we address these issues with two mathematical modelling approaches. The first approach is generic and uses probabilistic arguments to calculate the average number of affected sites when an outbreak is first detected, providing rapid and general insights that we have applied to a range of infectious diseases. The second approach uses a computationally intensive, stochastic, spatial model to simulate multiple outbreaks and to determine appropriate sentinel locations for UK apiaries. Both models quantify the anticipated increase in success of sentinel sites as their number increases and as non-sentinel sites become worse at detection; however, unexpectedly sentinels perform relatively better for faster growing outbreaks. Additionally, the spatial model allows us to quantify the substantial role that carefully positioned sentinels can play in the rapid detection of exotic invasions.

Due to its strong fertility and high-lying habitat, it is difficult to control. This study aimed to develop a system for the control of V. velutina nests using drones for detection and tracking the real-time location of the nests. Vespa velutina nest image data were acquired in Buan-gun and Wanju-gun (Jeollabuk-do), and artificial intelligence learning was conducted using YOLO-v5. Drone image resolutions of 640, 1280, 1920, and 3840 pixels were compared and analyzed.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The yellow-legged Asian hornet (Vespa velutina Lepeletier 1836 (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)) is naturally distributed in China, Southeast Asia and India; however it has since detected outside of its native area, confirmed as being established in South Korea, Europe and Japan. Health risks and deaths caused by the invasive Vespa velutina stings have become a public health concern, being the most common cause of anaphylaxis due to hymenopterans in some European regions. This in turn has led to increased demand from medical practitioners and researchers for Vespa velutina venom for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In this study, a straightforward, quick and inexpensive method for obtaining Vespa velutina venom by electric stimulation is described. The venom extracts were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), confirming the composition of the obtained material. The availability of Vespa velutina venom will lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic methods, mainly by venom immunotherapy (VIT), in patients allergic to this invasive species.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - The northern giant hornet, ¡i¿Vespa mandarinia¡/i¿ (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), was detected for the first time in North America in 2019. Four nests have since been located and removed in northwestern Washington State as part of an extensive survey and eradication program. This recent introduction into North America has prompted new research on the biology and ecology of ¡i¿V. mandarinia¡/i¿ to help inform management strategies. In its native range, ¡i¿V. mandarinia¡/i¿ is known to prey on a variety of insects including the economically important honey bee species ¡i¿Apis cerana¡/i¿ and ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿. Although ¡i¿A. cerana¡/i¿ has developed defense mechanisms against attack by ¡i¿V. mandarinia¡/i¿, ¡i¿A. mellifera¡/i¿ have no such defenses and an entire hive can be quickly destroyed by only a few hornets. In North America the hornet has been observed foraging on paper wasps (¡i¿Polistes dominula¡/i¿) and honey bees, but little else is known about prey use in its novel range. To address this knowledge gap, we employed a DNA metabarcoding approach to characterize species detected in larval feces collected from 3 of the 4 Washington ¡i¿V. mandarinia¡/i¿ nests found to date. Sequences were recovered for 56 species across fourteen orders, of which 36 species were likely prey items and 20 were suspected inquilines. The most frequently detected species were other social Hymenoptera, with ¡i¿Dolichovespula maculata¡/i¿, ¡i¿P. dominula¡/i¿, and ¡i¿A. mellifera¡/i¿ present in most samples. All of the species detected, except for ¡i¿A. mellifera¡/i¿, represent new prey records for ¡i¿V. mandarinia¡/i¿, with eight families of insects newly associated with giant hornets. These results suggest that ¡i¿V. mandarinia¡/i¿ in Washington preys on an assortment of insects similar to those documented in its native range, and that this new invader has readily incorporated novel species into its foraging and diet.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿Vespa velutina is the first Vespidae predator of honeybees to be accidentally introduced into Europe from Asia. This invasive hornet species typically hunts domestic honeybees by hovering at the hive entrance. Our capture‐markrecapture study shows that within the apiary, the distribution of V. velutina is heterogeneous. This is not related to the honeybee colony size but could reflect the variability in defensiveness between colonies (see pages 765–774). Photoed by Karine Monceau.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - Most terrestrial invertebrates are in considerable decline, and the range expansion of the invasive hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, poses an additional threat. Although now found in much of western Europe, the full extent of the hornet's predatory activity remains unexplored. While impacts on honey bees are well-documented, evidence of a wider dietary spectrum is emerging, indicating potentially broad ecological ramifications. Here, we conduct the first large-scale study of the diet of V. velutina, utilising deep sequencing to characterise the larval gut contents of over 1500 samples from Jersey, France, Spain, and the UK. Our results indicate that V. velutina is a highly flexible predator, enabling its continued range expansion capacity. Analyses detected 1449 taxa, with greater prey richness in samples from southern latitudes, and considerable spatiotemporal variation in dietary composition. Hymenoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Araneae were the most frequently occurring orders predated, each characterised by high taxonomic diversity. The honey bee Apis mellifera was the most abundant species, being found in all sampled nests and showing greater relative read numbers with increasing apiary density and proximity, supporting concerns for the impact of V. velutina on apiculture. Notably, 43 of the 50 most commonly predated invertebrates were also flower visitors, including 4 common bumblebee species, indicating potentially substantial risks to wild pollinators. These data provide wide and deep evidence to support risk evaluation of this species and its potential environmental impact as it spreads across Europe.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Asian hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax), a wasp species, has attacked honey bee populations and affected the beekeeping industry in Korea over the past 15 years. However, little research has been done with this invasive species. In this study, we investigated the intestine bacterial microbiota of Asian hornets and honey bees to design an attractive trap for Asian hornets. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genomic DNAs isolated from the intestine microorganisms of Asian hornets and honey bees were utilized to amplify bacterial 16S rDNA for the comparative sequence analysis. The next generation sequencing analysis identified that the orders Flavobacteriales as the most abundant intestinal microorganisms in Asian hornets, showing a clear difference compared to honey bees in which Aeromonadales are dominant. We also report five newly identified 16S rDNA sequences of Asian hornet intestinal bacteria. According to the sequence blast search, these five bacteria belong to the genera Thalassomonas, Caedobacter, Vampirovibrio, Alkaliphilus and Calothrix. CONCLUSION: While Asian hornets and honey bees show similar intestine bacterial diversity, the relative ratio of bacterial populations is different. providing useful information to design pest control agents specifically targeting Asian hornets.

AB  - Visual illusions are errors in signal perception and inform us about the visual and cognitive processes of different animals. Invertebrates are relatively less studied for their illusionary perception, despite the insight that comparative data provides on the evolution of common perceptual mechanisms. The Solitaire Illusion is a numerosity illusion where a viewer typically misperceives the relative quantities of two items of different colors consisting of identical quantity, with more centrally clustered items appearing more numerous. We trained European honeybees (¡i¿Apis mellifera)¡/i¿ and European wasps (¡i¿Vespula vulgaris¡/i¿) to select stimuli containing a higher quantity of yellow dots in arrays of blue and yellow dots and then presented them with the Solitaire Illusion. Insects learnt to discriminate between dot quantities and showed evidence of perceiving the Solitaire Illusion. Further work should determine whether the illusion is caused by numerical cues only or by both quantity and non-numerical spatial cues.

T2  - Global change biology
AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are considered one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, particularly through their interactions with other drivers of change. Horizon scanning, the systematic examination of future potential threats and opportunities, leading to prioritization of IAS threats is seen as an essential component of IAS management. Our aim was to consider IAS that were likely to impact on native biodiversity but were not yet established in the wild in Great Britain. To achieve this, we developed an approach which coupled consensus methods (which have previously been used for collaboratively identifying priorities in other contexts) with rapid risk assessment. The process involved two distinct phases: 1. Preliminary consultation with experts within five groups (plants, terrestrial invertebrates, freshwater invertebrates, vertebrates and marine species) to derive ranked lists of potential IAS. 2. Consensus-building across expert groups to compile and rank the entire list of potential IAS. Five hundred and ninety-one species not native to Great Britain were considered. Ninety-three of these species were agreed to constitute at least a medium risk (based on score and consensus) with respect to them arriving, establishing and posing a threat to native biodiversity. The quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, received maximum scores for risk of arrival, establishment and impact; following discussions the unanimous consensus was to rank it in the top position. A further 29 species were considered to constitute a high risk and were grouped according to their ranked risk. The remaining 63 species were considered as medium risk, and included in an unranked long list. The information collated through this novel extension of the consensus method for horizon scanning provides evidence for underpinning and prioritizing management both for the species and, perhaps more importantly, their pathways of arrival. Although our study focused on Great Britain, we suggest that the methods adopted are applicable globally.

AB  - Eavesdropping is predicted to evolve between sympatric, but not allopatric, predator and prey. The evolutionary arms race between Asian honey bees and their hornet predators has led to a remarkable defence, heat balling, which suffocates hornets with heat and carbon dioxide. We show that the sympatric Asian species, Apis cerana (Ac), formed heat balls in response to Ac and hornet (Vespa velutina) alarm pheromones, demonstrating eavesdropping. The allopatric species, Apis mellifera (Am), only weakly responded to a live hornet and Am alarm pheromone, but not to hornet alarm pheromone. We observed typical hornet alarm pheromone-releasing behaviour, hornet sting extension, when guard bees initially attacked. Once heat balls were formed, guards released honey bee sting alarm pheromones: isopentyl acetate, octyl acetate, (E)-2-decen-1-yl acetate and benzyl acetate. Only Ac heat balled in response to realistic bee alarm pheromone component levels (

T2  - PloS one
AB  - Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are exposed to multiple stressors such as pesticides, lack of forage, and diseases. It is therefore a long-standing aim to develop robust and meaningful indicators of bee vitality to assist beekeepers While established indicators often focus on expected colony winter mortality based on adult bee abundance and honey reserves at the beginning of the winter, it would be useful to have indicators that allow detection of stress effects earlier in the year to allow for adaptive management. We used the established honey bee simulation model BEEHAVE to explore the potential of different indicators such as population size, number of capped brood cells, flight activity, abundance of Varroa mites, honey stores and a brood-bee ratio. We implemented two types of stressors in our simulations: 1) parasite pressure, i.e. sub-optimal Varroa treatment by the beekeeper (hereafter referred as Biotic stress) and 2) temporal forage gaps in spring and autumn (hereafter referred as Environmental stress). Neither stressor type could be detected by bee abundance or honey reserves at the end of the first year. However, all response variables used in this study did reveal early warning signals during the course of the year. The most reliable and useful measures seem to be related to brood and the abundance of Varroa mites at the end of the year. However, while in the model we have full access to time series of variables from stressed and unstressed colonies, knowledge of these variables in the field is challenging. We discuss how our findings can nevertheless be used to develop practical early warning indicators. As a next step in the interactive development of such indicators we suggest empirical studies on the importance of the number of capped brood cells at certain times of the year on bee population vitality.

AB  - It has been speculated that insect chemosensory proteins (CSPs) may have additional roles beyond olfaction. In this study, the phylogenetic and genomic analyses of the CSPs of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, revealed the presence of gene gain-and-loss among different aphid field populations. Differential expressions of eight CSP genes were demonstrated after treatments with insecticides of different modes of action. The expression of AgosCSP5 was significantly upregulated by the insecticide treatments in a dose-dependent manner. The Drosophila flies overexpressing AgosCSP5 were significantly less susceptible to the insecticides, omethoate, imidacloprid and cypermethrin but not to deltamethrin and tau-fluvalinate, compared with control flies. The transgenic Drosophila flies exhibited an LC50 resistance ratio of 2.6 to omethoate, compared with control flies. Likewise, the mortality of the transgenic flies to imidacloprid and cypermethrin was significantly lower than that of the control flies (p ¡ 0.01). Homology modelling, molecular docking and dynamic simulation supported the interactions and revealed a higher stability of AgosCSP5/insecticide complexes than AgosCSP5/semiochemical complexes. Our study demonstrates for first time the in vivo evidence for the involvement of CSP genes in insecticide resistance of crop insect pests and provides new insights of the newly discovered CSP-mediated insect resistance mechanism to insecticides.

T2  - Entomologia Generalis
AB  - Collective defense is constrained by co-evolution with the predator such that species typically have effective defenses against sympatric, but not allopatric, predators.The honey bee, Apis mellifera, is allopatric with the predatory hornet, Vespa velutina auraria, and does not have effective defenses, unlike A. cerana, which is sympatric with this hornet.However, the reasons behind the decline of attacked A. mellifera colonies remain to be fully elucidated and are relevant given that invading V. velutina contributes to the decline of A. mellifera in multiple European countries.In southwest China, we show that A. mellifera ligustica, unlike the native A. cerana cerana, severely reduced foraging, and experienced higher hornet predation of foragers when attacked by native V. velutina auraria.Attacks resulted in reduced queen egg production, fewer pupae, and fewer workers and led to A. mellifera colony death.Decline began after only one week of hornet attacks, with A. mellifera queens significantly reducing their egg-laying even though the number of colony workers had not significantly fallen.In contrast, hornet attacks did not lead to declines in the same proxy measures of colony fitness for A. cerana.We suggest that, in addition to direct predation, predator-induced stress may contribute to A. mellifera colony declines, an intriguing possibility that accords with a growing body of research demonstrating that such stress can directly harm reproduction and thereby reduce fitness in multiple animals.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to purify potential allergenic components of Vespa velutina venom, the yellow legged Asian Hornet, and perform a preliminary characterization of the purified proteins. Starting from the whole venom of V.velutina, several chromatographic steps allowed to purify the phospholipase (named Vesp v 1), as well as the antigen 5 (Vesp v 5, the only allergenic component described as such so far). The two hyaluronidase isoforms found (Vesp v 2A and Vesp v 2B) cannot be separated from each other, but they are partially purified and characterized. Purity of the isolated proteins in shown by SDSPAGE, as well as by the results of the N-terminal sequencing. This characterization and nLC-MS/MS data provide most of the sequence for Vesp v 1 and Vesp v 5 (72 and 84

AB  - Transmission of honey bee viruses to other insects, and vice versa, has previously been reported and the true ecological importance of this phenomenon is still being realized. Members of the family Vespidae interact with honey bees via predation or through the robbing of brood or honey from colonies, and these activities could result in virus transfer. In this study we screened Vespa velutina and Vespa crabro collected from Europe and China and also honey bees and Vespula vulgaris from the UK for Moku virus (MV), an Iflavirus first discovered in the predatory social wasp Vespula pensylvanica in Hawaii.

AB  - Stern argues that today's integrated assessment models for quantifying the economic and societal impacts of climate change are inadequate (Nature 530, 407-409; 2016). We disagree with his view on the superiority of more complex models such as DSGE (dynamic stochastic computable general equilibrium) models, which purport to account for a larger class of uncertain future events. In our view, DSGE models have proved to be ineffective for policymaking, even in simple, short-term settings of pure economics, by failing to anticipate the onset of the recent recession (see P. Mirowski Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste 275-286; Verso, 2013). Three decades of social-sciences research on science and politics make it clear that cost-benefit models cannot tame policyrelevant uncertainties or promote political agreement (see, for example, D. Collingridge and C. Reeve Science Speaks to Power 3-4, 59-60; Pinter, 1986). Models that predict higher costs of climate change might make political intervention more palatable. But prescribing models that generate more precisely quantified estimates of a desired output is a political programme, not a scientific one. Responsible research requires responsible quantification and responsible acknowledgement of uncertainty.

AB  - Honey bee colonies have great societal and economic importance. The main challenge that beekeepers face is keeping bee colonies healthy under ever-changing environmental conditions. In the past two decades, beekeepers that manage colonies of Western honey bees (¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿) have become increasingly concerned by the presence of parasites and pathogens affecting the bees, the reduction in pollen and nectar availability, and the colonies' exposure to pesticides, among others. Hence, beekeepers need to know the health condition of their colonies and how to keep them alive and thriving, which creates a need for a new holistic data collection method to harmonize the flow of information from various sources that can be linked at the colony level for different health determinants, such as bee colony, environmental, socioeconomic, and genetic statuses. For this purpose, we have developed and implemented the B-GOOD (Giving Beekeeping Guidance by computational-assisted Decision Making) project as a case study to categorize the colony's health condition and find a Health Status Index (HSI). Using a 3-tier setup guided by work plans and standardized protocols, we have collected data from inside the colonies (amount of brood, disease load, honey harvest, etc.) and from their environment (floral resource availability). Most of the project's data was automatically collected by the BEEP Base Sensor System. This continuous stream of data served as the basis to determine and validate an algorithm to calculate the HSI using machine learning. In this article, we share our insights on this holistic methodology and also highlight the importance of using a standardized data language to increase the compatibility between different current and future studies. We argue that the combined management of big data will be an essential building block in the development of targeted guidance for beekeepers and for the future of sustainable beekeeping.

AB  - The predatory hornets have become one of the major limiting factors for commercial beekeeping. So, its incidence and predation rates were investigated at two different locations of sub-tropical plain areas of Parasi district, Nepal during five major hornet active months for 2016 and 2017. Observations were carried out on five Apis mellifera L. colonies, where the number of hornet and honeybee captured by hornet were assessed at three different times of the day for three continuous minutes every fortnightly. During the study periods, five major hornet species Vespa velutina Lepeletier, V. bicolor Fab., V. basalis Smith, V. tropica (Lin.) and V. mandarina Smith were observed. The hornet incidence varied significantly between different dates and locations, while between the years it was non-significant. The incidences as well as the predation rates were low during summer and early-autumn of both year but gradually increased to its peak in the autumn season during 2016, while during 2017, the predation rate increased to its maximum during autumn season. The predation rate was observed highest during early-November (50.44

T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - The yellow-legged or Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) is native to South-East Asia, and is a voracious predator of pollinating insects including honey bees. Since its accidental introduction into South-Western France in 2004, V. velutina has spread to much of western Europe. The presence of V. velutina in Great Britain was first confirmed in September 2016. The likely dynamics following an initial incursion are uncertain, especially the risk of continued spread, and the likely success of control measures. Here we extrapolate from the situation in France to quantify the potential invasion of V. velutina in Great Britain. We find that, without control, V. velutina could colonise the British mainland rapidly, depending upon how the Asian hornet responds to the colder climate in Britain compared to France. The announcement that a second hornet had been discovered in Somerset, increases the chance that the invasion first occurred before 2016. We therefore consider the likely site of first invasion and the probabilistic position of additional founding nests in late 2016 and early 2017. Given the potential dispersion of V. velutina, we conclude that vigilance is required over a large area to prevent the establishment of this threat to the pollinator population.

In this review, we provide a detailed overview of biomarkers for the molecular diagnosis of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera insect venoms in clinical practice, and we present, in a structured manner, their importance in differentiating genuine sensitizations versus cross-sensitizations using different diagnostic procedures. Updated algorithms are provided, along with the advantages and limitations of molecular diagnosis approaches. Geographical variations and rare species may pose further challenges in diagnosing and treating HVA, adding complexity to HVA management. This review informs readers about performing tailored diagnostics based on molecular allergen biomarkers and subsequent treatment strategies.

AB  - Aphids (order Hemiptera) are important insect pests of crops and are also vectors of many plant viruses. However, little is known about aphid-infecting viruses, particularly their diversity and relationship to plant viruses. To investigate the aphid viromes, we performed deep sequencing analyses of the aphid transcriptomes from infested barley plants in a field in Japan. We discovered virus-like sequences related to nege/kita-, flavi-, tombus-, phenui-, mononega-, narna-, chryso-, partiti-, and luteoviruses. Using RT-PCR and sequence analyses, we determined almost complete sequences of seven nege/kitavirus-like virus genomes; one of which was a variant of the Wuhan house centipede virus (WHCV-1). The other six seem to belong to four novel viruses distantly related to Wuhan insect virus 9 (WhIV-9) or Hubei nege-like virus 4 (HVLV-4). We designated the four viruses as barley aphid RNA virus 1 to 4 (BARV-1 to -4). Moreover, some nege/kitavirus-like sequences were found by searches on the transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) libraries of arthropods and plants. Phylogenetic analyses showed that BARV-1 forms a clade with WHCV-1 and HVLV-4, whereas BARV-2 to -4 clustered with WhIV-9 and an aphid virus, Aphis glycines virus 3. Both virus groups (tentatively designated as Centivirus and Aphiglyvirus, respectively), together with arthropod virus-like TSAs, fill the phylogenetic gaps between the negeviruses and kitaviruses lineages. We also characterized the flavi/jingmen-like and tombus-like virus sequences as well as other RNA viruses, including six putative novel viruses, designated as barley aphid RNA viruses 5 to 10. Interestingly, we also discovered that some aphid-associated viruses, including nege/kita-like viruses, were present in different aphid species, raising a speculation that these viruses might be distributed across different aphid species with plants being the reservoirs. This study provides novel information on the diversity and spread of nege/kitavirus-related viruses and other RNA viruses that are associated with aphids.

AB  - The classification of the European hornet, Vespa crabro, into subspecies based on thoracic and abdominal color patterns remains controversial. This study combined morphological assessments and mitochondrial genetic analyses to critically evaluate subspecies delimitation and introduction pathways of V. crabro, focusing on two traditionally recognized subspecies in Korea: V. c. crabroniformis and V. c. flavofasciata. Morphological examination of 163 Korean specimens identified 27 distinct color patterns. Furthermore, thoracic and abdominal characters exhibited weak correlation, thus limiting their utility as diagnostic markers. Genetic analysis using mitochondrial CO1 sequences revealed nine haplotypes among Korean populations that showed weak correspondence to the previously defined morphological subspecies. Furthermore, comparative genetic analyses demonstrated that Korean haplotypes are genetically distinct from both Japanese and European populations, indicating previously underappreciated geographic genetic diversity. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA analyses identified multiple independent invasion events into North America, originating from both European and Korean lineages. Collectively, our findings strongly challenge the validity of subspecies classifications relying solely on color patterns. Considering both morphological and genetic evidence, we conclude that V. crabro does not comprise clearly defined subspecies. Nonetheless, CO1 analysis effectively revealed provisional mitochondrial lineages, providing new insights into the invasion history and biogeographic structure of V. crabro.

AB  - Vespa velutina Lepieltier, 1836 (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) is an invasive predator of honeybees accidentally introduced into Europe from eastern Asia. It was observed for the first time in southwest France in 2004 and in the following years it rapidly spread almost all over the country. In 2013 it was officially reported in Italy, in the region Liguria, near the border with France. In three years it invaded the whole province of Imperia and it was occasionally reported also in the South Western of Piedmont and in one locality in South Eastern Piedmont. The VELUTINA project was funded in 2014 by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, with the aim of finding effective control methods against the predator. It includes both research and surveillance: adult and nest monitoring; development of methods for nest detection; development of protocols for nest destruction; studies on wasp chemical communication. Adult monitoring was performed in 5 Italian regions – the two where the hornet is already present and the three bordering ones – with the cooperation of Universities, research centres and beekeeping associations. Reports of V. velutina nests were collected from 2014 to 2016 thanks to the activity of the beekeeping association Apiliguria. Between 2014 and 2015 the presence of V. velutina was confirmed in the provinces were it was already present, with a small enlargement of the distribution area, both along the coast and the valleys, with no trespassing to other regions. Only recently, in November 2016, the presence of V. velutina was reported and confirmed by our institution in a locality of Veneto region, very near to the border with Lombardy and Emilia Romagna. At present, nest destruction represents the most effective method to limit the diffusion of the hornet, but it shows limitations and inconveniences. Nests are often difficult to locate and reach, their destruction is costly and risky for the staff and it is not regulated by official approved protocols. Within VELUTINA project some progresses have been made towards the official recognition of the method, thanks to the cooperation with national and regional institutions. After the end of Velutina project, the researchers of the project and the beekeeping associations of the invaded areas joined together in the scientific net Stopvelutina (www.stopvelutina.it), whose aim is to collect information and find new solutions to limit the spread of V. velutina. Beside the continuation of previous researches, a patent pending method was tested in summer 2016 to fight V. velutina adults in front of the apiaries in Liguria. From the first preliminary results the method resulted highly effective and it seems suitable to contrast the predator also in new invaded areas.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - The range of the invasive alien hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, has been expanding since its introduction to Korea in 2003. Here, we compare the aggressive behaviors and body size of V. velutina nigrithorax with five native hornet species to identify the interspecific hierarchies that influence the rate of spread of this species. Aggressive behaviors were classified into 11 categories, and each interaction was scored as a win, loss, or tie. We found that V. velutina was superior to V. simillima in fights that V. velutina won and showed a high incidence of threatening behavior. V. mandarinia outperformed V. velutina in fights that V. mandarinia won and grappling behavior was common. V. analis was superior to V. velutina in fights that V. analis won and showed a high degree of threatening behavior. V. crabro was superior to V. velutina in fights that V. crabro won and showed a high rate of threatening behavior. V. dybowskii was superior to V. velutina in fights that V. dybowskii won and showed a high incidence of threatening and grappling behaviors. The body size of V. velutina was greater than V. simillima (although not statistically significant) and smaller than all other Vespa species. Therefore, according to this study, the low interspecific hierarchies of V. velutina seem to be a major cause of the slower spread in Korea than in Europe. However, over time, its density has gradually increased within the forest, where it seems to be overcoming its disadvantages and expanding its range, possibly because the large colonies and good flying abilities of this species help it secure food.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿A key to healthy beekeeping is the Health Status Index (HIS) inspired by EFSA’s Healthy-B toolbox which we will make fully operational, with the active collaboration of beekeepers, by facilitating the coordinated and harmonised flow of data from various sources and by testing and validating each component thoroughly. We envisage a step&amp;amp;#2;by-step expansion of participating apiaries, and will eventually cover all EU biogeographic regions. The key to a sustainable beekeeping is a better understanding of its socio-economics, particularly within local value chains, its relationship with bee health and the human-ecosystem equilibrium of the beekeeping sector and to implement these insights into the data processing and decision making. We will fully integrate socio-economic analyses, identify viable business models tailored to different contexts for European beekeeping and determine the carrying capacity of the landscape. In close cooperation with the EU Bee Partnership, an EU-wide bee health and management data platform and affiliated project website will be created to enable sharing of knowledge and learning between scientists and stakeholders within and outside the consortium. We will utilise and further expand the classification of the open source IT-application for digital beekeeping, BEEP, to streamline the flow of data related to beekeeping management, the beehive and its environment (landscape, agricultural practices, weather and climate) from various sources. The dynamic bee health and management data platform will allow us to identify correlative relationships among factors impacting the HSI, assess the risk of emerging pests and predators, and enable beekeepers to develop adaptive management strategies that account for local and EU-wide issues. Reinforcing and establishing, where necessary, new multi-actor networks of collaboration will engender a lasting learning and innovation system to ensure social&amp;amp;#2;ecological resilient and sustainable beekeeping.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, is a recent invasive species in Galicia (NW Spain). Its invasion has an important socio-economic impact because it preys upon honeybees (Apis mellifera) and other crucial insect pollinators. The dispersal of this species must be monitored to minimise the damage it causes and to take the necessary control actions. The aims of this study were to determine target and nontarget living organisms captured by bait trapping and to compare the distribution patterns of V. velutina and the autochthonous V. crabro. Altitude and weather conditions played important roles in hornet behaviour. The traps placed in low-altitude coastal areas contained the most yellow-legged hornets. In contrast, the autochthonous hornet occurred in relatively greater numbers in the traps hung in high-altitude areas. High minimum temperatures, dew temperature, relative humidity and low maximum temperatures favour the occurrence and spread of V. velutina. These conditions are common in the coastal areas of this territory and promoted the rapid dispersal of this pest. The traps used were not bait-selective, so many other arthropod organisms were captured along with the hornet. Therefore, the use of species-selective baits is required for the ecofriendly effective management of this insect pest.

AB  - ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ is an invasive species that exhibits flexible social behavior, which may have contributed to its introduction in several European countries. It is important to understand its behavior in order to combat the effects of its introduction in different areas. This implies knowing the resources that it uses during its biological cycle. Hornets require protein resources taken from insects and organic matter as well as carbohydrates as an energy source to fly and also to forage for food and nest-building materials. The gastrointestinal tract of adults and larvae contains a wide variety of pollen types. The identification of this pollen in larvae collected from nests could offer information about the plant species that ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ visits as a foraging place. The main objective of this research was to study the pollen content in the gastrointestinal tract of larvae. Patterns of pollen content and pollen diversity were established according to the nest type, altitude, season, and location in the nest comb. The abundance of pollen types such as ¡i¿Eucalyptus¡/i¿, ¡i¿Castanea¡/i¿, ¡i¿Foeniculum vulgare¡/i¿, ¡i¿Hedera helix¡/i¿, ¡i¿Taraxacum officinale¡/i¿, ¡i¿Echium,¡/i¿ or ¡i¿Cytisus¡/i¿ pollen type stands out in many of the samples.

TI  - From ordinary environmentalism to the public environment: theoretical reflections based on French and European empirical research
AU  - Blanc, Nathalie
T2  - Ecology and Society
AB  - "Ecological transformations involve citizen mobilization and the cultural transformation of relationships with the environment. Rather than social movements, we need to see them more as social–environmental communities. They are formed through joint action on the material environment, underpinned by solidarity and conflicts of territoriality in which human collectives associate with living matter and the environment to battle other uses of space. The environment as a collective work then becomes a self-sustaining basis for action that boosts the competence and legitimacy of the actors (citizens, formal and informal collectives, etc.) and their role in social–ecological transition. We thus witness the emergence of a new type of environmental citizenship that deviates from political activism and testifies to a civic engagement in ordinary practices, a collective environmentalism that calls for public action and democracy. Our hypothesis is that ordinary environmentalism initiatives contribute to the production of a public environment, i.e., an environment that we may qualify as public insofar as urban citizen environmentalism contributes to the public space both in terms of debates and in a concrete manner. What we call ordinary environmentalism factors in environmental practices that have hitherto been considered negligible and emphasizes their usefulness in democratizing the coproduction of everyday and ordinary environments. We need to view the emergence of ordinary environmentalism in relation to distributions and inequalities in territories from an environmental and physical, as well as from a social, point of view or from the perspective of political commitment.

AB  - Metagenomic studies have demonstrated that viruses are extremely diverse and abundant in insects, but the difficulty of isolating them means little is known about the biology of these newly discovered viruses. To overcome this challenge in Drosophila, we created a cell line that was more permissive to infection and detected novel viruses by the presence of double-stranded RNA. We demonstrate the utility of these tools by isolating La Jolla virus (LJV) and Newfield virus (NFV) from several wild Drosophila populations. These viruses have different potential host ranges, with distinct abilities to replicate in five Drosophila species. Similarly, in some species they cause high mortality and in others they are comparatively benign. In three species, NFV but not LJV caused large declines in female fecundity. This sterilization effect was associated with differences in tissue tropism, as NFV but not LJV was able to infect Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium and induce follicular degeneration in the ovary. We saw a similar effect in the invasive pest of fruit crops Drosophila suzukii, where oral infection with NFV caused reductions in the fecundity, suggesting it has potential as a biocontrol agent. In conclusion, a simple protocol allowed us to isolate new viruses and demonstrate that viruses identified by metagenomics have a large effect on the fitness of the model organism D. melanogaster and related species.

AB  - Vespa velutina nigrithorax is an invasive species of hornet accidentally introduced into Europe in 2004. It feeds on invertebrates, including honey bees, and represents a threat to European apiculture. In 2016, the first nest of this hornet was detected and destroyed on mainland UK. A further 8 nests were discovered between 2016 and 2019. Nest dissection was performed on all nests together with microsatellite analyses of different life stages found in the nests to address the reproductive output and success of nests found in the UK. None of the nests had produced the next generation of queens. Follow-up monitoring in those regions detected no new nests in the following years. Diploid males were found in many UK nests, while microsatellite analysis showed that nests had low genetic diversity and the majority of queens had mated with one or two males. All UK nests derived from the European zone of secondary colonisation, rather than from the native range of the species. None of the nests discovered so far have been direct offspring of another UK nest. The evidence suggests that these nests were separate incursions from a continental population rather than belonging to a single established UK population of this pest.

AB  - Venom immunotherapy is the standard of care for people with severe reactions and has been proven to reduce risk of future anaphylactic events. There is a moral imperative to ensure production, supply and worldwide availability of locally relevant, registered, standardized commercial venom extracts for diagnosis and treatment. Insects causing severe immediate allergic reactions vary by region worldwide. The most common culprits include honeybees (Apis mellifera), social wasps including yellow jackets (Vespula and Dolichovespula), paper wasps (Polistes) and hornets (Vespa), stinging ants (Solenopsis, Myrmecia, Pachycondyla, and Pogonomyrmex), and bumblebees (Bombus). Insects with importance in specific areas of the world include the Australian tick (Ixodes holocyclus), the kissing bug (Triatoma spp), horseflies (Tabanus spp), and mosquitoes (Aedes, Culex, Anopheles). Reliable access to high quality venom immunotherapy to locally relevant allergens is not available throughout the world. Many current commercially available therapeutic vaccines have deficiencies, are not suitable for, or are unavailable in vast areas of the globe. New products are required to replace products that are unstandardized or inadequate, particularly whole-body extract products. New products are required for insects in which no current treatment options exist. Venom immunotherapy should be promoted throughout the world and the provision thereof be supported by health authorities, regulatory authorities and all sectors of the health care service.

AB  - ¡jats:title¿Abstract¡/jats:title¿¡jats:p¿The invasive yellow‐legged hornet (¡jats:italic¿Vespa velutina nigrithorax¡/jats:italic¿ Buysson, 1905) is a social hymenopteran native to Asia and an invasive species in Europe. This species poses a significant threat to local ecosystems and economies across Europe due to its predation on a wide range of insects, mainly honeybees. Despite its presence on the European continent for nearly 20 years, there is limited information about its trophic spectrum. This study aims to unravel the qualitative prey spectrum of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ within the local entomofauna using DNA metabarcoding tools. Meconium samples were collected from yellow‐legged hornet nests removed in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) and DNA barcodes were amplified and sequenced using an arthropod‐specific mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) primer set. Results showed that a fraction of the detected diet is unique to each nest and revealed a preference for Apidae, Calliphoridae, Vespidae, Muscidae, and Sarcophagidae insect prey. The study also identified the potential impacts of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ on local insect populations with diverse functional roles, highlighting the ecological implications of this invasive species. The implementation of advanced molecular techniques allowed us to assess the dietary diversity of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ and its potential role in shaping local entomofaunal communities. This research enhances our understanding of predator–prey interactions in invaded ecosystems and underscores the importance of DNA metabarcoding tools for studying the foraging behavior of invasive species.¡/jats:p¿

T2  - Journal of comparative physiology. B, Biochemical, systemic, and environmental physiology
AB  - Thermal variation has complex effects on organisms and they respond to these effects through combined behavioral and physiological mechanisms. However, it is less clear how these traits combine in response to changes in body condition (e.g., size, hydration) and environmental factors that surround the heating process (e.g., relative humidity, start temperatures, heating rates). We tested whether these body conditions and environmental factors influence sequentially measured Voluntary Thermal Maxima (VTmax) and Critical Thermal Maxima, (CTmax) in leaf-cutting ants (Atta sexdens rubropilosa, Forel, 1908). VTmax and CTmax reacted differently to changes in body size and relative humidity, but exhibited similar responses to hydration level, start temperature, and heating rate. Strikingly, the VTmax of average-sized workers was closer to their CTmax than the VTmax of their smaller and bigger sisters, suggesting foragers maintain normal behavior at higher temperatures than sister ants that usually perform tasks within the colony. Previous experiments based on hot plate designs might overestimate ants’ CTmax. VTmax and CTmax may respond concomitantly or not to temperature rises, depending on body condition and environmental factors.

AB  - The beekeeping sector is suffering from the detrimental effects of climate change, both directly and indirectly. Despite numerous studies conducted on this subject, large-scale research incorporating stakeholders' and beekeepers' perspectives has remained elusive. This study aims to bridge this gap by assessing the extent to which stakeholders involved in the European beekeeping sector and European beekeepers perceive and experience the impacts of climate change on their operations, and whether they had to adapt their practices accordingly. To this end, a mixed-methods study including in-depth stakeholder interviews (n = 41) and a pan-European beekeeper survey (n = 844) was completed within the frame of the EU-funded H2020-project B-GOOD. The development of the beekeeper survey was informed by insights from literature and the stakeholder interviews. The results highlighted significant regional disparities in the perceived impacts of climate change, with beekeepers in Southern European regions expressing more negative outlooks, while Northern European beekeepers reported more favourable experiences. Furthermore, survey analysis revealed beekeepers who were classified as 'heavily impacted' by climate change. These beekeepers reported lower average honey yields, higher colony winter loss rates and a stronger perceived contribution of honey bees to pollination and biodiversity, underscoring climate change's detrimental impacts on the beekeeping sector. Multinomial logistic regression revealed determinants of the likelihood of beekeepers being classified as 'heavily impacted' by climate change. This analysis indicates that Southern European beekeepers experienced a 10-fold likelihood of being classified as heavily impacted by climate change compared to Northern European beekeepers. Other significant factors distinguishing 'winners' and 'losers' were self-reported level of professionalism as a beekeeper (ranging from pure hobbyist to fully professional, Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.31), number of years active in beekeeping (OR = 1.02), availability of floral resources throughout the bee season (OR = 0.78), beehives located in a forested environment (OR = 1.34), and the presence of local policy measures addressing climate change-related challenges (OR = 0.76).

T2  - Insects
AB  - Wild bees are facing a global decline mostly induced by numerous human factors for the last decades. In parallel, public interest for their conservation increased considerably, namely through numerous scientific studies relayed in the media. In spite of this broad interest, a lack of knowledge and understanding of the subject is blatant and reveals a gap between awareness and understanding. While their decline is extensively studied, information on conservation measures is often scattered in the literature. We are now beyond the precautionary principle and experts are calling for effective actions to promote wild bee diversity and the enhancement of environment quality. In this review, we draw a general and up-to-date assessment of the conservation methods, as well as their efficiency and the current projects that try to fill the gaps and optimize the conservation measures. Targeting bees, we focused our attention on (i) the protection and restoration of wild bee habitats, (ii) the conservation measures in anthropogenic habitats, (iii) the implementation of human made tools, (iv) how to deal with invasive alien species, and finally (v) how to communicate efficiently and accurately. This review can be considered as a needed catalyst to implement concrete and qualitative conversation actions for bees.

The results indicated the superiority of the data for the averages annual numbers of traps were (pink, yellow, green, and comparison) was (78.9), (110.8), (80.1) and (30) respectively. The average number of wasps trapped (84.8), (98.1), (79.4) and (79.2) by taste traps (pear juice, date palms juice, grape juice and control (the sugar solution)), respectively. The efficiency of colored traps on attracting wasps from transparent traps (without color), the mean of yellow traps significantly different from other by (110.8) wasps/trap however the efficiency of the rest of color traps adhesively better than control, as well as the taste of dates palm juice significantly on average (98.1) wasp / trap higher compare to the rest of the juice traps.

AB  - 1. Invasive alien species are a major threat to biodiversity. In addition to predation and parasitism, native species might suffer from competition when invasive alien species occupy a similar ecological niche. 2. This study focused on the potential interspecific interaction between two hornets: the Asian yellow‐legged hornet, Vespa velutina, a high‐concern invasive alien species recently arrived in Europe; and the native European hornet, Vespa crabro. The two species share a similar ecological niche and V. velutina is rapidly expanding across Europe, which suggests that V. crabro might suffer from competition. 3. Under laboratory‐controlled conditions, two life‐history traits that might cause the two species to compete were investigated: (i) the ability of workers to find food sources and their flexibility in exploiting them (through individual food item choice tests and exploration assays); and (ii) the worker resistance to pathogens (through immune challenge tests). 4. The results show that trophic preference of both species highly overlaps, with a marked dietary preference for honeybees compared with other insect prey and non‐prey protein items. No differences were observed in the exploratory behaviour of both species. Finally, constitutive antibacterial activity was greater in workers of the native species than in workers of the invasive hornet. 5. This laboratory study provides a first assessment under controlled conditions of the factors affecting competition between workers of two hornet species and proposes a framework to assess, in wild contexts, the magnitude of the competition and the impact of the introduced V. velutina on the native V. crabro.

TI  - Data from : Insect-mediated pollination improves fruit quality of strawberries in an urban environment
AU  - Blareau, Elsa

T2  - Figshare
AB  - This dataset result from an experiment in an urban area near Paris (France) to test whether pollinators present in an urban environment contributed to the production of strawberries (¡i¿Fragaria × ananassa¡/i¿). We performed flower-visitor observations and pollination experiments on strawberries, ¡i¿Fragaria × ananassa¡/i¿, in an urban area near Paris, France, in order to assess the effects of (¡i¿i¡/i¿) insect-mediated pollination service and (¡i¿ii¡/i¿) potential pollination deficit on fruit set, seed set, and fruit quality (size, weight and malformation). Flower-visitor observations revealed that the pollinator community was solely comprised of unmanaged pollinators, despite the presence of apiaries in the surrounding landscape. Based on the pollination experiments, we found that the pollination service mediated by wild insects improved fruit size as a qualitative value of production, but not fruit set. We also found no evidence for pollination deficit in our urban environment. These results suggest that the local community of wild urban pollinators is able to support strawberry crop production, and thus plays an important role in providing high quality, local and sustainable crops in urban areas. The data are related to the scientific paper "Blareau, E., Sy, P., Daoud, K., Requier, F. (under review) Economic costs of the invasive Yellow-legged hornet on honey bees. ¡i¿Insects¡/i¿".Three datasets are available:(1) Flower visitor observations were performed during the whole flowering period, from the 20¡sup¿th¡/sup¿ of April to the 27¡sup¿th¡/sup¿ of May 2021 (24 observation days). Flower visitor observations consisted of a 10 minutes observation sessions carried out between 9am and 6pm. We favoured days with temperatures above 12°C, with little cloud cover and no wind although some observation sessions were carried out on cloudy days since several occurred during the flowering period. Each flower was observed several times (i.e. several 10 minute observation sessions per flower) but never on the same day. Subsequent observations of a same flower were carried out at a later date at different times of day, in order to maximise our chances of seeing a diversity of pollinators, since different pollinators are active at different times of day [5,55]. Over the flowering period, we carried out 30 h and 10 min of flower observations (181 time replicates of 10-minute observations) on a total of 88 flowers (each observed on average 2.9 ± 1.1 times). We observed an average of 10.7 ± 7.4 flowers per day. An average of 4.4 ± 2.3 flowers were observed per location. Each flower visitor was counted and identified within the following 8 categories: honey bee (¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿), bumble bee (¡i¿Bombus¡/i¿ sp.), solitary bee, hoverfly (Syrphidae), other fly (Diptera), ant (Formicidae), thrips (Thysanoptera) or other insect.Data are available as a csv file titled " Flower.visitors.csv” with the following metadata:# METADATA# 'data.frame': 257 obs. of 11 variables:# FlowerID:Factorvariable;identityoftheflower# Honey bee : Numeric variable; number of honey bees observed# Bumblebee:Numericvariable;numberofbumblebeesobserved# Solitary bee: Numeric variable; number of solitary bees observed# Hoverfly:Numericvariable;numberofhoverfliesobserved# Other fly : Numeric variable; number of other flies observed# Ant:Numericvariable;numberofantsobserved# Beetle : Numeric variable; number of beetles observed# Spider:Numericvariable;numberofspidersobserved# Thrip : Numeric variable; number of thrips observed# Otherinsect:Numericvariable;numberofotherinsectsobserved<br>(2)Weperformedpollinationtreatmentsateachlocationduringthesametimeperiodaspollinatorobservations,toassesspollinationservicesprovidedbytheurbanpollinatorcommunity.Thefourtreatmentsareasfollows:(<i>i</i>)flowersopentopollinatorvisits,(<i>ii</i>)flowersopentopollinatorvisitsandcrosspollinatedbyhand,(<i>iii</i>)flowersexcludedfrompollinatorvisits(selforwindpollinationonly),and(<i>iv</i>)flowerscross-pollinatedbyhandandexcludedfrompollinatorvisits.Comparingself/windandhandpollinationmeasurespollinatordependence.Comparingself/windandopenpollinationmeasurespollinationservice,i.e.thecontributionofinsectpollinatorstocropproduction.Comparingopenandhandpollinationmeasurespollinationdeficit,i.e.whetherpollinatorsareabletosaturatetheflowerinpollen,thusallowingittoproducefruitatitshighestpotential.Comparingopenpollinationwithandwithouthandpollinationindicateswhetherinsectpollinationaloneissufficienttomaximisefruityield.Thecomparisonofhandpollinationandopenpollinationwithhandpollinationindicateswhetherhandpollinationonlyisenoughtomaximisefruitproduction,orweatheraninputfrompollinatorsisnecessary.Plantsfromtheself/windpollinationtreatmentandthehandpollinationtreatmentwerebaggedwithmeshnetting(Alt’DrosoMaraichage,0.8×0.8mmmesh)topreventpollinatorsfromvisitingtheseflowers.Fortreatmentsthatrequiredhandpollination,pollenwascollectedfromthestudyplants.Wevisitedeachflowertwicewithinthesamedaywithapaintbrushtoensureflowersofthesametreatmentreceivedpollenfromseveralotherplants.Intotal,172flowerswereconsideredforthepollinationexperiment,46flowerswereaffectedtotheopenpollinationtreatment(2.3±1.2perlocation),28tothehandandopenpollinationtreatment(1.4±0.9perlocation),63totheself/windpollinationtreatment(3.2±1.5perlocation),and35tothehandpollinationtreatment(1.8±1.3perlocation).Oncefloweringwasover,wemeasuredfruitsetbyrecordingwhethereachflowerfromeachpollinationtreatmentsuccessfullyproducedfruitornot.Dataareavailableasacsvfiletitled"Fruit.set.csv”withthefollowingmetadata:#METADATA#'data.frame':172obs.of3variables:# Location : Factor variable ; identity of the location of the plant# Treatment:Factorvariable;identityofthepollinationtreatmentwith:Oforflowersopentopollinatorvisits;O+Hforflowersopentopollinatorvisitsandcrosspollinatedbyhand;Eforflowersexcludedfrompollinatorvisits(selforwindpollinationonly),andE+Hforflowerscross-pollinatedbyhandandexcludedfrompollinatorvisits# Fruit set: Numeric variable; fruit set with O for failure (no fruit) and 1 for success (fruit formed)¡br¿(3) Fruits were then harvested once they were fully formed (i.e. as soon as fruits had fully reddened), between the 31¡sup¿st¡/sup¿ of May and the 10¡sup¿th¡/sup¿ of June 2021.

AB  - Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are often used to predict the potential range of invasive species. Unfortunately, most studies do not evaluate variables relevance before selecting them to fit their models. Moreover, multiple variables such as climate and land use may drive species distribution at different spatial scales but most studies either use a single type of drivers, or combine multiple types without respecting their operating scale. We propose a three steps framework to overcome this limitation. First, use SDMs to select the most relevant climatic variables to predict a given species distribution, at continental scale. Then, characterize the species-habitat relationships, at a local scale, to produce species and area specific habitat filters. Finally, combine both information, each obtained at a relevant scale, to refine climatic predictions according to habitat suitability. We illustrate this framework with 14,794 Asian hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) records. We show that integrating multiple drivers, while still respecting their scale of effect, produced a potential range 55.9

AB  - Genetic bottlenecks can limit the success of populations colonizing new ranges. However, successful colonizations can occur despite bottlenecks, a phenomenon known as the genetic paradox of invasion. Eusocial Hymenoptera such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) should be particularly vulnerable to genetic bottlenecks, since homozygosity at the sex-determining locus leads to costly diploid male production (DMP). The Tree Bumblebee (Bombus hypnorum) has rapidly colonized the UK since 2001 and has been highlighted as exemplifying the genetic paradox of invasion. Using microsatellite genotyping, combined with the first genetic estimates of DMP in UK B. hypnorum, we tested two alternative genetic hypotheses ('bottleneck' and 'gene flow' hypotheses) for B. hypnorum's colonization of the UK. We found that the UK population has not undergone a recent severe genetic bottleneck and exhibits levels of genetic diversity falling between those of widespread and range-restricted Bombus species. Diploid males occurred in 15.4

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The invasive yellow-legged hornet (¡jats:italic¿Vespa velutina nigrithorax¡/jats:italic¿) was introduced into France in 2004 from China and has now spread across western Europe and into Great Britain. Between 2016 and 2022, 13 ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina nigrithorax¡/jats:italic¿ nests were sporadically found and destroyed in England. In 2023, 72 nests were found and destroyed by the Animal and Plant Health Agency’s National Bee Unit (NBU) inspectors across southern and northern England. In 2024, 24 nests were found and destroyed. To better understand the potential establishment of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina nigrithorax¡/jats:italic¿ in Great Britain, a model was developed to simulate its dispersal and the associated control efforts. We simulated public reporting based on the realistic distribution of observers in the landscape, the genetic load due to the presence of diploid males, and continued incursions into a freely breeding population. We estimated the number of years before officials tasked with locating and destroying nests became overwhelmed by the number of nests in the landscape. In the absence of reporting, an undetected population would be large enough to overwhelm control efforts after three to seven years (i.e. the person-days required to locate and destroy nests would exceed those available). When nests were reported by members of the public and beekeepers, control efforts could continue for at least 10 years before becoming overwhelmed – depending on the national reporting probability, the abundance of observers in the landscape, and the annual incursion rate.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - Diptera, with their participation in pollination, significantly contribute to the maintenance of plant diversity, and they also have great potential for assessing habitat health and preserving it. A decline in their abundance and diversity has been recorded worldwide as a consequence of biotic, abiotic, and anthropic alterations. In addition to pollinators, these orders include agricultural and forestry pests, which are a threat to both cultivated and wild plants that are very important to the economy. Many pests have escaped from their native areas, and it is important to monitor their spread to implement sustainable means of control. Our study provides baseline information on Diptera and Vespidae diversity in the Mediterranean mosaic of agroecosystems, giving information on the importance of human influence on insect diversity. We carried out an insect inventory in Istria, Croatia, using a set of traps placed in the proximity of beehives. This study was also important in determining the presence of pests and newly introduced species. A total of 94 species from 24 families were recorded-7 important agricultural pests of Diptera and 17 new records for Croatia. The correlation between species diversity and environmental and anthropogenic factors leads to the conclusion that total insect species richness, pest species richness, and the first findings depend on human activities. The number of honeybee colonies negatively correlated with species richness, while anthropic influence positively affected total and pest species richness.

AB  - The current context of biodiversity loss is particularly marked by the Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) of honeybees due to multiple causes, toxicological, parasitic and viral. The beekeeper has to face these difficulties in order to maintain the population of bees to save the species but also to make its exploitation profitable. According studies, one can understand what is happening inside the hive by observing what is going on outside. In this context, we propose to individually capture by video the flight trajectories of bees and then characterize the pace of the global activity in front of the hive to infer observations that will be consolidated and made available to apicultural data scientists. Thus bee are detected and tracked using image and video processing methods, then the trajectory are modeled. Then, from the extracted data outcome of the videos, curves are fitted as the ideal trajectories of each bee path in order to study and classify their behaviors. Thus, for each tracked bee, the points of extracted centered positions are time-ordered approximated on a plan. The chosen method interpolates the abscissae separately from the ordinates as time-dependent functions before plotting the parametric curve for each bee path individually. Thus, the abscissae as the ordinates are interpolated using cubic splines. The consecutive points to be interpolated are connected by polynomials of degree three. The first and second derivatives of these polynomials must be connected too. This allows the curve to look more natural by avoiding tingling and convexity discontinuities. Finally, it represents the continuity of the speed of the bees too. Experiments on synthetic and real videos show precise detections of the bee paths. Looking forward, through the collected data, the bee behavior could be understood by using machine learning and the semi supervised method must be one way to proceed.

AB  - ¡jats:title¿Abstract¡/jats:title¿¡jats:p¿The yellow-legged hornet (¡jats:italic¿Vespa velutina¡/jats:italic¿) is a social Hymenoptera native from Asia and an invasive species in Europe, where it was first detected in France in 2004. Since then, the species has spread across the continent invading mainland Spain and Mallorca island (Balearic archipelago, Western Mediterranean) in 2010 and 2015, respectively. Yellow-legged hornets cause severe damage to ecosystem by predating over a wide variety of pollinators including honeybees. Such a threat situation requires the development of effective management and prevention plans, which can greatly benefit from knowing both the origin and the genetic structure of the invading populations. Here we conduct a genetic study to shed light on both the origin and the phylogenetic relationships of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ populations from Mallorca and mainland Spain using nuclear (STRs) and mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1) gene markers. Our results show that Mallorca populations originated from invasive European specimens. Moreover, FST values, DAPC and genetic structure analysis suggest two independent incursions in the island with bottleneck and founder effect signatures. Finally, we contribute additional genetic evidence of the polyandrous behavior of this invasive species based on the inference of a mean number of mattings per nest of 3.94 (range 2–6.5). This study supports the human-mediated pathways of this species and highlights the importance of implementing effective biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of invasive alien species in island habitats.¡/jats:p¿

T2  - Journal of Chemistry
AB  - Since diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common and serious endocrine metabolic disorders, it is important to elucidate novel antidiabetic therapeutic agents from various sources, including natural products. Bee venom (BV) is a complex mixture of proteins, peptides, and low molecular components, and melittin is the main constituent. Melittin is a peptide consisting of 26 amino acids with the sequence GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIKRKRQQ. It has several important biological effects and has a relatively low toxicity. Recent studies using animal models have confirmed that melittin has significant glucose and lipid lowering activities by acting on several mechanistic pathways. The main antidiabetic activity of melittin is increasing insulin secretion via depolarization of pancreatic β-cells. Other possible mechanisms may involve stimulation of phospholipase A2, increase of glucose uptake, improving lipid profile, and/or reduction of inflammation. This review summarizes the various sources, proteomics, biological roles, adverse effects, and medical applications of melittin and its mechanism of action in combating DM.

This hornet, a ferocious hunter of pollinating insects, poses a serious threat to biodiversity and pollination services. Despite ongoing efforts, its extermination in continental Europe is hampered by a lack of effective control methods, thus effective mitigation measures are primary concerns. The aims of this work were: (i) to study the effects of V. velutina predating on honey bee colonies, and (ii) to assess the effectiveness of electric harps in reducing hunting pressure and predation. We assessed the predation pressure and compared honey bee colony performance, body weight of workers, and winter survivorship for protected versus unprotected colonies in 36 experimental hives across three apiaries.¡/AbstractText¿ ¡AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS"¿Electric harps protected honey bees by reducing predation pressure and therefore mitigating foraging paralysis. Consequently, foraging activity, pollen income, brood production and worker body weight were higher in protected colonies which in turn showed greater winter survivorship than those that were unprotected, especially at sites with intermediate to high levels of predation.¡/AbstractText¿ ¡AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS"¿The predation of V. velutina affects foraging activity, breeding, body weight and colony survivorship of Apis mellifera. Electric harps contribute significantly to mitigate the impact of this invasive hornet on apiaries; however, they should be deployed in tandem with additional measures to preserve honey bee colony stocks, such as facilitating access to food sources for colonies during the periods of highest predation pressure. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - ¡jats:title¿Abstract¡/jats:title¿¡jats:p¿Hosts can carry many viruses in their bodies, but not all of them cause disease. We studied ants as a social host to determine both their overall viral repertoire and the subset of actively infecting viruses across natural populations of three subfamilies: the Argentine ant (¡jats:italic¿Linepithema humile¡/jats:italic¿, Dolichoderinae), the invasive garden ant (¡jats:italic¿Lasius neglectus¡/jats:italic¿, Formicinae) and the red ant (¡jats:italic¿Myrmica rubra¡/jats:italic¿, Myrmicinae). We used a dual sequencing strategy to reconstruct complete virus genomes by RNA-seq and to simultaneously determine the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq), which constitute the host antiviral RNAi immune response. This approach led to the discovery of 41 novel viruses in ants and revealed a host-ant specific RNAi response (21 vs. 22 nt siRNAs) in the different ant species. The efficiency of the RNAi response (sRNA/RNA read count ratio) depended on the virus and the respective ant species, but not its population. Overall, we found the highest virus abundance and diversity per population in¡jats:italic¿Li. humile¡/jats:italic¿, followed by¡jats:italic¿La. neglectus¡/jats:italic¿and¡jats:italic¿M. rubra¡/jats:italic¿. Argentine ants also shared a high proportion of viruses between populations, whilst overlap was nearly absent in¡jats:italic¿M. rubra¡/jats:italic¿. Only a single of the total 59 viruses in our study caused active infection in more than one ant species, whilst six viruses infected one, but only contaminated another ant species. Disentangling active infection from contamination thus allowed us to show high host-specificity of active viral infections versus a decent degree of spillover of non-infecting viral contaminants across ant species, providing relevant information for ecosystem management.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - The invasive yellow-legged hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax was accidentally introduced in Europe in the early 2000s. As is the case in colonies of other wasp and hornet species, V. velutina colonies are known to produce sexuals (males and new queens) at the end of the summer. We show that early-stage colonies in French populations frequently produce males well before the usual reproductive period. The vast majority of the males produced are diploid, which is consistent with the loss of genetic diversity previously reported in introduced populations in France. Since males do not participate in colony activities, the production of early diploid males at the expense of workers is expected to hamper colony growth and, ultimately, decrease the expansion of the species in its invasive range in Europe.

AB  - Managed bee species provide essential pollination services that contribute to food security worldwide. However, managed bees face a diverse array of threats and anticipating these, and potential opportunities to reduce risks, is essential for the sustainable management of pollination services. We conducted a horizon scanning exercise with 20 experts from across Europe to identify emerging threats and opportunities for managed bees in European agricultural systems. An initial 63 issues were identified, and this was shortlisted to 21 issues through the horizon scanning process. These ranged from local landscape-level management to geopolitical issues on a continental and global scale across seven broad themes-Pesticides & pollutants, Technology, Management practices, Predators & parasites, Environmental stressors, Crop modification, and Political & trade influences. While we conducted this horizon scan within a European context, the opportunities and threats identified will likely be relevant to other regions. A renewed research and policy focus, especially on the highest-ranking issues, is required to maximise the value of these opportunities and mitigate threats to maintain sustainable and healthy managed bee pollinators within agricultural systems.

AB  - Climate change is expected to have strong social-ecological implications, with global but especially regional and local challenges. To assess the climatic vulnerability of a given territory, it is necessary to evaluate its exposure to climate change and its adaptive capacity. This study describes the development of an Action Plan for Adapting to Climate Change in the Tâmega and Sousa Region, a mountainous inter-municipal community in the North of Portugal. The goals were to identify the main impacts of climate change on water resources, agriculture, forests, biodiversity, and socioeconomic sectors, as well as to develop a plan, merging local and scientific knowledge through a transdisciplinary lens. This study describes an approach that combines modelling methods, applied in the different sectors, and participatory methods, based on the analysis of the perceptions of local actors. Results indicate that the target region will experience a generalized increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation, which will negatively impact all studied social-ecological dimensions. Overall, local business and institutional agents perceive the primary and tourism sectors as the most vulnerable in the region. The described framework demonstrates the engagement process between relevant scientific experts and local practitioners, as well as how it is critical to understand the impacts of climate change and to support the co-design of an adaptation plan, which in turn can guide political and economic decision-making towards effective implementation of the plan. In addition, the difficulties and challenges encountered during this process are discussed to support future plans and strategies for local adaptation.

AB  - Vespa velutina nigrithorax (du Buysson, 1905) invazivna je azijska podvrsta strsljena, pripada vrsti Vespa velutina (Lepeletier, 1836). U Europi je prvi put pronađena 2004. u jugozapadnoj Francuskoj. Tijekom slijedecih godina slijedilo je ubrzano sirenje strsljena susjednim francuskim pokrajinama pa je tako do sada prosiren na cjelokupnu zapadnu polovinu francuskog teritorija. Slijede nalazi u susjednim zemljama: Spanjolska, 2010., Portugal 2011., Belgija 2011. i Italija 2013. Strsljen V. v. nigrithorax poznat je po intenzivnom predatorstvu nad zadružnim kukcima (red Hymenoptera), posebice medonosnim pcelama (Apis mellifera). Gnjezda ovog strsljena mogu brojiti i do 15.000 jediniki, stoga njegovo invazivno sirenje uzrokuje visestruke stete, kao sto su: gubitci u pcelarstvu, narusavanje ekoloske uloge pcela, utjecaj na izmjenu bioraznolikosti te moguce jake alergijske reakcije na ubod u preosjetljivih osoba. Rad donosi pregled literaturnih podataka o biologiji strsljena V. v. nigrithorax, sirenju i trenutnoj raspostranjenosti na podrucju Europe, predviđanjima o buducem sirenju te mjerama suzbijanja.

AB  - Since the rise of agriculture, human populations have domesticated plant and animal species to fulfil their needs. With modern agriculture, a limited number of these species has been massively produced over large areas at high local densities. Like invasive species, these Massively Introduced Managed Species (MIMS) integrate local communities and can trigger cascading effects on the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Here, we focus on plant and insect MIMS in the context of plant–pollinator systems. Several crop species such as mass flowering crops (e.g. Brassica napus) and domesticated pollinating insects (e.g. Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris) have been increasingly introduced worldwide and their impact on natural communities is addressed by an increasing number of scientific studies. First, we review the impacts of major insect and plant MIMS on natural comm- unities by identifying how they affect other species through competition (direct and apparent competition) or facilitation (attraction, spillover). Second, we show how MIMS can alter the structure of plant–pollinator networks. We specifically analysed the position of A. mellifera from 63 published plant–pollinator webs to illustrate that MIMS can occupy a central position in the networks, leading to functional consequences. Finally, we present the features of MIMS in sensitive environments ranging from oceanic islands to protected areas, as a basis to discuss the impacts of MIMS in urban context and agrosystems. Through the case study of MIMS in plant–pollinator interactions, we thus provide here a first perspective of the role of MIMS in the functioning of ecosystems.

AB  - The European Parliament requested EFSA to develop a holistic risk assessment of multiple stressors in honey bees. To this end, a systems-based approach that is composed of two core components: a monitoring system and a modelling system are put forward with honey bees taken as a showcase. Key developments in the current scientific opinion (including systematic data collection from sentinel beehives and an agent-based simulation) have the potential to substantially contribute to future development of environmental risk assessments of multiple stressors at larger spatial and temporal scales. For the monitoring, sentinel hives would be placed across representative climatic zones and landscapes in the EU and connected to a platform for data storage and analysis. Data on bee health status, chemical residues and the immediate or broader landscape around the hives would be collected in a harmonised and standardised manner, and would be used to inform stakeholders, and the modelling system, ApisRAM, which simulates as accurately as possible a honey bee colony. ApisRAM would be calibrated and continuously updated with incoming monitoring data and emerging scientific knowledge from research. It will be a supportive tool for beekeeping, farming, research, risk assessment and risk management, and it will benefit the wider society. A societal outlook on the proposed approach is included and this was conducted with targeted social science research with 64 beekeepers from eight EU Member States and with members of the EU Bee Partnership. Gaps and opportunities are identified to further implement the approach. Conclusions and recommendations are made on a way forward, both for the application of the approach and its use in a broader context.

Les donnees epidemiocliniques recentes indiquent une baisse marquee de son incidence au point que d’endemique la maladie pourrait aujourd’hui etre requalifiee de sporadique. Parallelement, de nouvelles techniques analytiques ont permis de montrer que l’agent causal cohabitait depuis peu avec une nouvelle espece d’origine asiatique, Nosema ceranae. Ces deux especes aux caracteristiques morphologiques et biologiques proches occupent une meme niche ecologique : les enterocytes du ventricule des abeilles adultes. L’espece emergente Nosema ceranae, dont l’infection est plutot asymptomatique, est aujourd’hui predominante. La mondialisation des echanges d’abeilles, les bouleversements environnementaux peuvent etre des facteurs essentiels a l’implantation de nouveaux parasites. La disparition progressive de la nosemose en France est un exemple de la complexite des relations hotes-parasites ainsi que de notre incapacite a prevoir l’emergence d’organismes exotiques.

AU  - Lee, Si Hyeock

T2  - Toxins
AB  - The primary functions of venoms from solitary and social wasps are different. Whereas most solitary wasps sting their prey to paralyze and preserve it, without killing, as the provisions for their progeny, social wasps usually sting to defend their colonies from vertebrate predators. Such distinctive venom properties of solitary and social wasps suggest that the main venom components are likely to be different depending on the wasps’ sociality. The present paper reviews venom components and properties of the Aculeata hunting wasps, with a particular emphasis on the comparative aspects of venom compositions and properties between solitary and social wasps. Common components in both solitary and social wasp venoms include hyaluronidase, phospholipase A2, metalloendopeptidase, etc. Although it has been expected that more diverse bioactive components with the functions of prey inactivation and physiology manipulation are present in solitary wasps, available studies on venom compositions of solitary wasps are simply too scarce to generalize this notion. Nevertheless, some neurotoxic peptides (e.g., pompilidotoxin and dendrotoxin-like peptide) and proteins (e.g., insulin-like peptide binding protein) appear to be specific to solitary wasp venom. In contrast, several proteins, such as venom allergen 5 protein, venom acid phosphatase, and various phospholipases, appear to be relatively more specific to social wasp venom. Finally, putative functions of main venom components and their application are also discussed.

AB  - The highabundance and impact on honeybees of the Asian hornet Vespa velutina var. nigrithorax have caused great concern among European public authorities and beekeepers. The species was reported for the first time in France in 2005 and spread out across 66 European districts (ca. 360 000 km 2 ) within 7 years (INPN, 2012; Rome et al., 2013). Its arrival was reported in 2010 in Northern Spain, in 2011 in Portugal and Belgium and in 2013 in Italy. Its wider expansion in Europe is soon to be expected.We discuss here the advances of the collaborative research project initiated in 2008 in France.1. The potential invasion risk of the species was assessed using modeling tools of climatic suitability (Villemant et al., 2011, Barbet-Massin et al., 2013). Interestingly, the potential distribution of V. v. nigrithorax matches the current distribution of another invasive social wasp, the German yellow jacket, Vespula germanica (Beggs et al., 2011).2. Apartfrom reported damages on hives, little is known on the biology of V. velutina throughout its native Asian range. In the invaded range, the impact of V. v. nigrithorax on the diversity and biomass of the invertebrate fauna is under study. Preliminary results reported a diversified diet varying among seasons and habitat types.3. The genetic variability between individuals of V. v. nigrithorax from France and Asia was assessed in order to describe the history of its invasion. The analysis has evidenced a low variability among the invasive population, which indicates a single introduction of one or more queens. The sampling of specimens in France and in the area of origin has been extended to confirm this hypothesis and the most probable area of origin (Arca, 2012).Given the potential economic and biological impact of V. v. nigrithorax, a better understanding of its invasion dynamics is necessary to predict regions at risk, hence to help with planning dedicated control measures, a prerequisite for replacing the reactive nature of current solutions with a proactive, predictive approach.

AB  - Vespa velutina is a hornet predator of bees that was accidentally introduced in Europe from China in 2004. Since its arrival, it expanded through Europe, impacting both biodiversity and beekeeping. As there are currently no biological alternatives to chemical treatment of V. velutina nests, we need more studies on the development of potential biological control methods. We present here a further description of an indigenous strain of entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana that was discovered naturally parasitizing a foundresses of V. velutina in France. The genus was identified by its macro and micro morphological characteristics and the specie by molecular techniques. It growing preferences were described according temperature conditions, and the potential in using such entomopathogens as a biological control agent against V. velutina was also discussed here, first at least to replace currently occurring direct chemical treatments, and then potentially to be integrated in future Trojan horse strategies.

AB  - The world of honeybees (A. mellifera) are facing dramatic changes. Since the late 1990s, beekeepers around the world have observed mysterious and sudden disappearance of bees, and reported unusually high rates of decline in honeybee colonies. In the same time, the numerous studies show also a decline of other pollinators’ populations. The main causes seldom incriminated are climate change, pesticide use, habitat loss, parasites, but looking at real issues leading to honeybees’ populations reduction, but some french studies show that major problems are pesticides (52

AB  - Contrary to native predators, which have co-evolved with their prey, alien predators often benefit from native prey naivete. Vespa velutina, a honeybee predator originating from Eastern China, was introduced into France just before 2004. The present study, based on video recordings of two beehives at an early stage of the invasion process, intends to analyse the alien hornet hunting behaviour on the native prey, Apis mellifera, and to understand the interaction between the activity of the predator and the prey during the day and the season. Chasing hornets spent most of their time hovering facing the hive, to catch flying honeybees returning to the hive. The predation pressure increased during the season confirming previous study based on predator trapping. The number of honeybee captures showed a maximum peak for an intermediate number of V. velutina, unrelated to honeybee activity, suggesting the occurrence of competition between hornets. The number of honeybees caught increased during midday hours while the number of hornets did not vary, suggesting an increase in their efficacy. These results suggest that the impact of V. velutina on honeybees is limited by its own biology and behaviour and did not match the pattern of activity of its prey. Also, it could have been advantageous during the invasion, limiting resource depletion and thus favouring colonisation. This lack of synchronization may also be beneficial for honeybee colonies by giving them an opportunity to increase their activity when the hornets are less effective.

AB  - This study investigated the perception of 13 invasive alien animal species (IAAS) by 220 teacher students and their attitudes towards species management, either with or without prior information about the IAAS presented. In a first questionnaire, the IAAS (eight vertebrates, five invertebrates) were presented as photographs and their invasive status was not revealed. In a second questionnaire, one half of the participants received information about the invasive character of the species, the other half did not. Then, attitudes of both groups towards various management options were assessed. Mammals such as grey squirrel, raccoon and raccoon dog were considered most beautiful and wanted, but the harlequin ladybird, an insect, was also considered attractive. Participants who had received information about the invasive character of the species presented were more in favor of eradication and partial removal than those who had not, but still less willing to remove mammals and birds than arthropods. The present results highlight the importance of information on IAAS so that teacher students can understand the reasons for certain types of management. As multipliers of tomorrow, they might be better prepared for teaching this topic in school.

AB  - The invasive hornet ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ affects apiculture, biodiversity, and human health. The use of baited traps with the aim of reducing the population and mitigating its impacts is a common practice. However, the lack of impact on the number of colonies and the high capture rate of non-target insects make it controversial. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness and selectiveness of four trap models. We measured effectiveness as the capture rate of ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ per day per trap, and selectiveness as the capture rate of ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿/capture rate of non-target species. The E trap had better performance with a higher selectiveness and effectiveness. Traps V and X had a higher effectiveness but the lowest selectiveness, with high capture rates of native insects, including threatened species. The R trap had the lowest effectiveness and selectiveness. Results show that small changes in the design can contribute to achieving more sustainable tools. Otherwise, with the current tools, bait trapping continues to be non-sustainable from an environmental perspective due to the impacts on native biodiversity.

T2  - Viruses
AB  - The global spread of a parasitic mite (Varroa destructor) has resulted in Deformed wing virus (DWV), a previously rare pathogen, now dominating the viromes in honey bees and contributing to large-scale honey bee colony losses. DWV can be found in diverse insect taxa and has been implicated in spilling over from honey bees into associated (“apiary”) and other (“non-apiary”) insects. Here we generated next generation sequence data from 127 insect samples belonging to diverse taxa collected from Hawaiian islands with and without Varroa to identify whether the mite has indirectly affected the viral landscapes of key insect taxa across bees, wasps, flies and ants. Our data showed that, while Varroa was associated with a dramatic increase in abundance of (predominantly recombinant) DWV in honey bees (and no other honey bee-associated RNA virus), this change was not seen in any other taxa sampled. Honey bees share their environment with other insect populations and exist as a homogenous group, frequently sharing common viruses, albeit at low levels. Our data suggest that the threat of Varroa to increase viral load in an apiary does not automatically translate to an increase in virus load in other insects living in the wider community.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The European hornet, ¡jats:italic¿Vespa crabro¡/jats:italic¿ L. (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), is a eusocial insect native to Eurasia that was accidentally introduced in the island of Sardinia (Italy) in 2010. This alien generalist predator could impact on native insect species through predation or competition by modifying interspecific relations in sensitive island ecosystems. As part of the Interreg project ALIEM, the present work regarded the first monitoring activity of the European hornet conducted in Sardinia by means of verified citizen science. The main goals of this study were to define the distribution area of the wasp in 2018 and evaluate the profile and the performance of citizen scientists. Our results showed that ¡jats:italic¿V. crabro¡/jats:italic¿ is mainly located in north-eastern Sardinia and that the hotspot was probably the commercial port of Olbia. Furthermore, data provided by contributors were very accurate and none of the parameters considered to define the participants (age, gender, education level, job category) was a true predictor of a volunteer’s ability to recognise the wasp. In conclusion, this small-scale study suggests that citizen scientists could be a valuable aid to monitor already-established alien species and could be part of a surveillance network for early detection of other potentially invasive alien species not yet introduced in Sardinia, such as the yellow-legged hornet, ¡jats:italic¿Vespa velutina¡/jats:italic¿, which is already present in northern Italy.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - ¡p¿The first target of the Convention for Biological Diversity (Aichi target 1) was to increase public awareness towards the values of biodiversity and actions needed to conserve it - a key prerequisite for other conservation targets. Nevertheless, monitoring success in achieving this target at a global scale is difficult. However, the increased digitization of human life in recent decades offers an insight in people’s interests at an unprecedented scale, which allows a more comprehensive evaluation of success towards Aichi target 1 than previously attempted. Here, we used Google search volume data to evaluate global interest in biodiversity and its conservation, and investigated their correlates across countries. We found that during 2013-2020 global searches for biodiversity increased, driven mostly by searches for charismatic fauna. However, searches for conservation actions, driven mostly by searches for national parks, decreased since 2019 likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We further found that economic inequality was negatively correlated with interest in biodiversity and conservation, while purchasing power was indirectly positively correlated through increased education and research. Our results suggest partial success towards achieving Aichi target 1, in that interest in biodiversity has increased widely, but not for conservation. We suggest that increased outreach and education efforts towards neglected aspects of biodiversity and conservation are still needed. Popular topics in biodiversity and conservation could be leveraged to increase awareness of other topics, with attention to local socioeconomic contexts.¡/p¿

AB  - AbstractThe yellow-legged Asian hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, which originated from Asia, has invaded several countries, including South Korea. In Korea, V. velutina nigrithorax predation on honeybees is one of the most serious factors threatening apiculture. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of V. velutina to better understand the mitogenomic characteristics of this species. The 16,475 bp mitogenome of V. velutina consists of a typical set of genes, with an arrangement identical to that of congeneric species. Vespa velutina possesses the shortest A + T-rich region (132 bp) among congeneric Vespa, and this is also the shortest in the superfamily Vespoidea. Phylogenetic analysis using the 13 protein-coding genes of Vespoidea species indicated that each family forms strongly supported monophyletic groups (Bayesian posterior probability =1; ML, 100

AB  - Since the beginning of the last century, the number of biological invasions has continuously increased worldwide. Due to their environmental and economical consequences, invasive species are now a major concern. Social wasps are particularly efficient invaders because of their distinctive biology and behavior. Among them, the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, is a keen hunter of domestic honeybees. Its recent introduction to Europe may induce important beekeeping, pollination, and biodiversity problems. Hornets use olfactory cues for the long-range detection of food sources, in this case the location of honeybee colonies, but the exact nature of these cues remains unknown. Here, we studied the orientation behavior of V. velutina workers towards a range of hive products and protein sources, as well as towards prominent chemical substances emitted by these food sources. In a multiple choice test performed under controlled laboratory conditions, we found that hornets are strongly attracted to the odor of some hive products, especially pollen and honey. When testing specific compounds, the honeybee aggregation pheromone, geraniol, proved highly attractive. Pheromones produced by honeybee larvae or by the queen were also of interest to hornet workers, albeit to a lesser extent. Our results indicate that V. velutina workers are selectively attracted towards olfactory cues from hives (stored food, brood, and queen), which may signal a high prey density.

AB  - ¡jats:sec¿ ¡jats:title¿Abstract¡/jats:title¿ ¡jats:p¿Invasive alien species could generate a multitude of impacts towards native species. The introduction and spread of ¡jats:italic¿Vespa velutina¡/jats:italic¿ in Europe is raising concern for the conservation of insect’s biodiversity, including wasps due to predation, competition or a combination of these two mechanisms. Nevertheless, most evidence for negative effects on other wasps are based on laboratory experiments, direct observations, and on considerations about the biology and ecology of Vespidae. No field study in Europe explored how the abundance of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ could affect the population of native Vespidae, as expected in case of competition and predation. We analysed how the abundance of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ influenced that of ¡jats:italic¿Vespa crabro¡/jats:italic¿, 4 years after the arrival and establishment of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ in our study area, in Italy. Moreover, we compared the abundances of three native Vespidae (¡jats:italic¿V. crabro¡/jats:italic¿, ¡jats:italic¿Vespula vulgaris¡/jats:italic¿, ¡jats:italic¿Vespula germanica¡/jats:italic¿), between our study area and an adjacent uninvaded area with similar environmental conditions. Bayesian Generalized Linear Models revealed that the abundance of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ and ¡jats:italic¿V. crabro¡/jats:italic¿ was positively associated, where ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ was scarce. Covariation disappeared only at those trapping sites where ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ was extremely abundant. Moreover, abundances of native wasps were similar between the invaded and the uninvaded areas.¡/jats:p¿ ¡/jats:sec¿¡jats:sec¿ ¡jats:title¿Implications for insect conservation¡/jats:title¿ ¡jats:p¿The wide-scale monitoring activity performed to investigate the effects of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ on native wasps has not detected any negative effects in relation to the presence of the invasive species.

AB  - During oviposition, ectoparasitoid wasps not only inject their eggs but also a complex mixture of proteins and peptides (venom) in order to regulate the host physiology to benefit their progeny. Although several endoparasitoid venom proteins have been identified, little is known about the components of ectoparasitoid venom. To characterize the protein composition of Torymus sinensis Kamijo (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) venom, we used an integrated transcriptomic and proteomic approach and identified 143 venom proteins. Moreover, focusing on venom gland transcriptome, we selected additional 52 transcripts encoding putative venom proteins. As in other parasitoid venoms, hydrolases, including proteases, phosphatases, esterases, and nucleases, constitute the most abundant families in T. sinensis venom, followed by protease inhibitors. These proteins are potentially involved in the complex parasitic syndrome, with different effects on the immune system, physiological processes and development of the host, and contribute to provide nutrients to the parasitoid progeny. Although additional in vivo studies are needed, initial findings offer important information about venom factors and their putative host effects, which are essential to ensure the success of parasitism.

AB  - Since the discovery that honey bee viruses play a role in colony decline, researchers have made major breakthroughs in understanding viral pathology and infection processes in honey bees. Work on virus transmission patterns and virus vectors, such as the mite Varroa destructor, has prompted intense efforts to manage honey bee health. However, little is known about the occurrence of honey bee viruses in bee predators, such as vespids. In this study, we characterized the occurrence of 11 honey bee viruses in five vespid species and one wasp from four provinces in China and two vespid species from four locations in France. The results showed that all the species from China carried certain honey bee viruses, notably Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV), Deformed wing virus (DWV), and Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV); furthermore, in some vespid colonies, more than three different viruses were identified. In France, DWV was the most common virus; Sacbrood virus (SBV) and Black queen cell virus (BQCV) were observed in one and two samples, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of IAPV and BQCV sequences indicated that most of the IAPV sequences belonged to a single group, while the BQCV sequences belonged to several groups. Additionally, our study is the first to detect Lake Sinai virus (LSV) in a hornet from China. Our findings can guide further research into the origin and transmission of honey bee viruses in Vespidae, a taxon of ecological, and potentially epidemiological, relevance.

T2  - NeoBiota : advancing research on alien species and biological invasions
AB  - ¡jats:p¿Understanding the mechanisms that potentiate the dispersion of an invasive species is essential to anticipate its arrival into new regions and to develop adequate management actions to minimize damage to biodiversity and society. One of the most successful invaders in Europe, the yellow-legged hornet (¡jats:italic¿Vespa velutina¡/jats:italic¿), is dispersing through self-diffusion and jump dispersal. Using information on species occurrence in Portugal from 2013 to 2018, this study aimed to understand the range expansion trajectory of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ and to identify the role of climate, landscape and anthropogenic variables on the two mechanisms of spread. We found that in Portugal the invasion is proceeding faster southwards (45 km/year) along the Atlantic coast than eastwards (20 km/year) where the climatic suitability gradient is more compressed, with jump dispersal playing an important role in this difference and in the acceleration of the invasion process. Dispersal by diffusion was best explained by the annual range of temperature and precipitation of the wettest month, with distance to shrub land also having an important role. Additionally, jump dispersal appeared to be facilitated by motorways, hinting at the role of human-mediated dispersal. Indeed, the number of nests that resulted from this dispersive mechanism were significantly closer to motorways than expected by chance. To prevent the dispersal of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ into Mediterranean regions, and in addition to a special attention to the advancing front, early monitoring programs should also target a buffer zone on both sides of motorways, and at freight shipping hubs.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - Honey is a well-known natural sweetener and is rich in natural antioxidants that prevent the occurrence of oxidative stress, which is responsible for many human diseases. Some of the biochemical compounds in honey that contribute to this property are vitamins and phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids and flavonoids. However, the extent to which these molecules contribute towards the antioxidant capacity in vitro is inconsistently reported, especially with the different analytical methods used, as well as other extrinsic factors that influence these molecules’ availability. Therefore, by reviewing recently published works correlating the vitamin, total phenolic, and flavonoid content in honey with its antioxidant activities in vitro, this paper will establish a relationship between these parameters. Based on the literature, vitamins do not contribute to honey’s antioxidant capacity; however, the content of phenolic acids and flavonoids has an impact on honey’s antioxidant activity.

AB  - The Oriental hornet (¡i¿Vespa orientalis¡/i¿) is one of the major predators of honey bees. It has been demonstrated that adults of ¡i¿V. orientalis¡/i¿ can harbor honey bee viruses, however the transmission route of infection is still not clear. The aim of this study was to study the possible presence of honey bee viruses in ¡i¿V. orientalis¡/i¿ larvae and honey bees collected from the same apiary. Therefore, 29 samples of ¡i¿V. orientalis¡/i¿ larvae and 2 pools of honey bee (¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿). samples were analyzed by multiplex PCR to detect the presence of six honeybee viruses: Acute Bee Paralysis Virus (ABPV), Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV), Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV) and Sac Brood Virus (SBV). Biomolecular analysis of ¡i¿V. orientalis¡/i¿ larvae revealed that DWV was present in 24/29 samples, SBV in 10/29, BQCV in 7/29 samples and ABPV in 5/29 samples, while no sample was found positive for CBPV or KBV. From biomolecular analysis of honey bee samples DWV was the most detected virus, followed by SBV, BQCV, ABPV. No honey bee sample was found positive for CBPV or KBV. Considering the overlapping of positivities between ¡i¿V.orientalis¡/i¿ larvae and honey bee samples, and that ¡i¿V.orientalis¡/i¿ larvae are fed insect proteins, preferably honey bees, we can suggest the acquisition of viral particles through the ingestion of infected bees. However, future studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis and rule out any other source of infection.

AB  - The invasion of Vespa velutina presents a great threat to the agriculture economy, the ecological environment, and human health. An effective strategy for this hornet control is urgently required, but the limited genome information of Vespa velutina restricts the application of molecular-genomic tools for targeted hornet management. Therefore, we conducted large-scale transcriptome profiling of the hornet brain to obtain functional target genes and molecular markers. Using an Illumina HiSeq platform, more than 41 million clean reads were obtained and de novo assembled into 182,087 meaningful unigenes. A total of 56,400 unigenes were annotated against publicly available protein sequence databases and a set of reliable Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) markers were developed. The homologous genes encoding crucial behavior regulation factors, odorant binding proteins (OBPs), and vitellogenin, were also identified from highly expressed transcripts. This study provides abundant molecular targets and markers for invasive hornet control and further promotes the genetic and molecular study of Vespa velutina.

AB  - ¡jats:title¿Abstract¡/jats:title¿ ¡jats:p¿The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax du Buysson, 1905, is a common predator of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, Linnaeus. It has become an invasive species in several territories around the world, constituting a major threat to beekeeping in those areas. Management strategies are based on destroying the hornets’ nests, trapping adults, or physical interventions to protect honey bee colonies. However, there is a lack of information on how beekeepers should manage their colonies when the yellow-legged hornet is present. Here we present an overview of the life cycle and identification of the yellow-legged hornet, and common control methods used in apiaries. Moreover, we highlight the importance of management techniques for improving honey bee colony survival, including recommendations for beekeepers to achieve better colony health and strength. Essential for such management is close attention to colony food reserves and the provision of extra food when honey bee foraging is stopped by yellow-legged hornets predating foragers in front of the hive. Weak or diseased honey bee colonies succumb easily to the predator; therefore colony strength is key to survival. Although more research is needed to improve control strategies of this invasive species, this manuscript is a useful guide for honey bee colony management in invaded areas.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - The yellow-legged hornet Vespa velutina is an invasive alien species in many areas of the world. In Europe, it is considered a species of Union concern and national authorities have to establish surveillance plans, early warning and rapid response systems or control plans. These strategies customarily require the assessment of the areas that could be colonised beyond outbreaks or expanding ranges, so as to establish efficient containment protocols. The hornet is spreading through a mix of natural diffusion and human-mediated transportation. Despite the latter dispersion mode is hardly predictable, natural diffusion could be modelled from nest data of consecutive years. The aim of this work is to develop a procedure to predict the spread of the yellow-legged hornet in the short term in order to increase the efficiency of control plans to restrain the diffusion of this species. We used data on the mean distances of colonial nests between years to evaluate the probability of yellow-legged hornet dispersal around the areas where the species is present. The distribution of nests in Italy was mainly explained by elevation (95

AB  - Long-range sex pheromones are generally considered to be a main cue for mate recognition in the order Hymenoptera. Although considerable attention has been given to the identification of semiochemicals in the superfamily Chalcidoidea, which comprises 19 families, no study has identified active components in a field bioassay. We herein report the sensitive and selective pheromone communication system of the Korean apricot wasp, Eurytoma maslovskii (Eurytomidae), whose larvae feed on Prunus mume seeds. Using gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we detected 2,10-dimethyldodecyl propionate and 2,8-dimethyldecyl propionate in thoracic extracts of female E. maslovskii at a ratio of 8:2 as the active pheromone components. Field experiments showed that the attractive effect of the two compounds is highly enantioselective. Racemic 2,10-dimethyldodecyl propionate and 2,8-dimethyldecyl propionate were not attractive to E. maslovskii males. In bioassays with single enantiomers, the (2 S,10 R)-enantiomer was highly attractive to male wasps, and the (2 S,8 S)-enantiomer was also attractive, although to a lesser degree. No synergistic effect between (2 S,10 R)- and (2 S,8 S)-enantiomers was identified, and the (2 S,10 R)-enantiomer alone caught significantly more males than the natural pheromone extracts. The addition of other enantiomers to the (2 S,10 R)-isomer significantly decreased the attraction of conspecific males. In addition, a very low dose of synthetic pheromone attracted conspecific males, showing that both female signaling and male response traits may have evolved to contribute to species-specific sexual communication in this species.

AB  - Pathogen spillover events are of global concern as they have the potential to cause significant harm to the novel host species. The potential of viral spillover from the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) to other insects is well established. New variants should inevitably emerge following a host expansion, yet to our knowledge no study has shown this within this system. To investigate the outcome of viral spillover, we sequenced the RNA biased viromes of sympatric A. mellifera (n = 389) and common eastern bumblebee Bombus impatiens (n = 117) over three years. Distinct viromes occurred within each bee species throughout the study duration, with only one of the well-characterized honey bee viruses, sacbrood virus, consistently found in the bumblebee virome. Viruses shared by both bees shared over 98

AB  - Observations were made in the south-west region of France on the activity and behaviour of Vespa velutina workers from a nest reared in captivity as well as from free-living colonies. Seasonal nest development, daily extranidal activity, daily time budget allocated to nest construction and carbohydrates, water, pulp or prey collection were determined from the captive colony. In the meantime, nestmate and non-nestmate interactions were assessed. The percentages of pulp pellets and prey collections brought back by foragers were also determined from the free-living colonies and showed a noticeable preference of the hornet for honey bees. These preliminary data allow further investigations on the biology and behaviour of this Asian invasive species in the view to better assess its impact on biodiversity in France. Resume.

AB  - Emerging viruses have caused concerns about pollinator population declines, as multi-host RNA viruses may pose a health threat to pollinators and associated arthropods. In order to understand the ecology and impact these viruses have, we studied their host range and determined to what extent host and spatial variation affect strain diversity. Firstly, we used RT-PCR to screen pollinators and associates, including honey bees (Apis mellifera) and invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), for virus presence and replication. We tested for the black queen cell virus (BQCV), deformed wing virus (DWV), and Kashmir bee virus (KBV) that were initially detected in bees, and the two recently discovered Linepithema humile bunya-like virus 1 (LhuBLV1) and Moku virus (MKV). DWV, KBV, and MKV were detected and replicated in a wide range of hosts and commonly co-infected hymenopterans. Secondly, we placed KBV and DWV in a global phylogeny with sequences from various countries and hosts to determine the association of geographic origin and host with shared ancestry. Both phylogenies showed strong geographic rather than host-specific clustering, suggesting frequent inter-species virus transmission. Transmission routes between hosts are largely unknown. Nonetheless, avoiding the introduction of non-native species and diseased pollinators appears important to limit spill overs and disease emergence.

AB  - Since its introduction in France 10 years ago, the Yellow-legged Asian bee-hawking hornet Vespa velutina has rapidly spread to neighboring countries (Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, and Germany), becoming a new threat to beekeeping activities.While introduced species often leave behind natural enemies from their original home, which benefits them in their new environment, they can also suffer local recruitment of natural enemies.Three mermithid parasitic subadults were obtained from V. velutina adults in 2012, from two French localities.However, these were the only parasitic nematodes reported up to now in Europe, in spite of the huge numbers of nests destroyed each year and the recent examination of 33,000 adult hornets.This suggests that the infection of V. velutina by these nematodes is exceptional.Morphological criteria assigned the specimens to the genus Pheromermis and molecular data (18S sequences) to the Mermithidae, due to the lack of Pheromermis spp.sequences in GenBank.The species is probably Pheromermis vesparum, a parasite of social wasps in Europe.This nematode is the second native enemy of Vespa velutina recorded in France, after a conopid fly whose larvae develop as internal parasitoids of adult wasps and bumblebees.In this paper, we provide arguments for the local origin of the nematode parasite and its limited impact on hornet colony survival.We also clarify why these parasites (mermithids and conopids) most likely could not hamper the hornet invasion nor be used in biological control programs against this invasive species.

AB  - Eusocial wasps are represented in the Vespidae by the subfamilies Stenogastrinae, Vespinae and Polistinae. These wasps present colonies that are sometimes composed of thousands of individuals which live in nests built with paper materials. The high density of the adult and larval population, as well as the stable micro environment of the nests, make very favourable conditions for the flourishing of various types of microorganisms. These microorganisms, which may be pathogens, are beneficial and certainly contribute to model the sociality of these insects. The mutualistic relationships that we observe in some species, especially in Actinomycete bacteria and yeasts, could have important fallouts for the development of new medicines and for the use of these insects in agricultural environments.

AB  - Hornets (Vespa spp) are top insect predators so are beneficial in controlling pests, but their venomous stings and defensive behavior cause numerous human deaths throughout Asia. Normally hornets inhabit rural areas so reducing potential conflict with humans. In 2003 the invasive hornet Vespa velutina arrived in Southern Korea (Yeongdo region), where it became established and is currently spreading northwards at a rate of 10–20 km per year. Despite originating in tropical/subtropical areas of Indo-China its nesting biology and life cycle in South Korea are similar to that found throughout its native range, with mature colonies containing 1,000–1,200 adults. We found that in seven years V. velutina has become the most abundance hornet species in Southern Korea by displacing other native species such as V. simillima, which has a similar nesting biology. Worryingly we also found a very significant positive correlation between the abundance of V. velutina and degree of urbanization, indicating this invasive species was well adapted to urban environments. This was supported by our finding that 41

AB  - In Southeast Asia the native honey bee species Apis cerana is often attacked by hornets (Vespa velutina), mainly in the period from April to November. During the co-evolution of these two species honey bees have developed several strategies to defend themselves such as learning the odors of hornets and releasing alarm components to inform other mates. However, so far little is known about whether and how honey bees modulate their olfactory learning in the presence of the hornet predator and alarm components of honey bee itself. In the present study, we test for associative olfactory learning of A. cerana in the presence of predator odors, the alarm pheromone component isopentyl acetate (IPA), or a floral odor (hexanal) as a control. The results show that bees can detect live hornet odors, that there is almost no association between the innately aversive hornet odor and the appetitive stimulus sucrose, and that IPA is less well associated with an appetitive stimulus when compared with a floral odor. In order to imitate natural conditions, e.g. when bees are foraging on flowers and a predator shows up, or alarm pheromone is released by a captured mate, we tested combinations of the hornet odor and floral odor, or IPA and floral odor. Both of these combinations led to reduced learning scores. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the prey-predator system between A. cerana and V. velutina.

AB  - Following the recent introduction of Vespa velutina into France, an increase in predation on domestic honeybees, Apis mellifera, has resulted from the dispersion of this hornet across the country. We aimed at providing its predation pressure dynamics at bee hives in two sites by using food traps that could be used as a comparison in future years. The number of trapped and chasing hornets in each apiary was correlated. Predation lasted 5 months on our two sites; 916 and 1,894 hornets were trapped on each site, respectively. Predation at bee hives was found to be affected by wind speed and by the seasonal effect of temperature and humidity. We also show that V. velutina queens and males were present during unusual periods in our traps, which may be significant to understanding their life cycle. These results are discussed with reference to the biology of other Vespine species. This study represents the first monitoring of V. velutina predation pressure dynamics in France. It constitutes an initial database for pest management and suggests ways of protecting bee hives.

AB  - The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, was accidentally introduced from Southeast Asia and then invaded France and Korea over the last 10 years. Since its introduction, its predation on honeybee colonies has rapidly become an economic problem in invaded countries. Using mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase and 22 nuclear microsatellite loci, we showed that native hornet populations were well differentiated and highly diverse. In contrast, introduced populations from France and Korea suffered a genetic bottleneck, which did not prevent their rapid geographic expansion. Analysis of the genetic data indicates that French and Korean populations likely arose from two independent introduction events. The most probable source population is from an area between the Chinese provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu. This invasion route is in agreement with knowledge on trade and historical records. By studying colonies of V. velutina, we demonstrated its polyandry, which is very rare among Vespidae. This mating behavior could have favored the success of this Asian hornet in Europe and Korea. Combined, the population and colony results suggest that very few or possibly only one single multi-mated female gave rise to the invasion.

AB  - ¡i¿Pomacea canaliculata¡/i¿ is one of the most notorious invasive aquatic snail, capable of influencing various aquatic organisms through their secretions. ¡i¿Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri¡/i¿ and ¡i¿Propsilocerus akamusi¡/i¿ are the most prevalent and powerful bioturbators in aquatic ecosystems. However, the mechanism of ¡i¿P. canaliculata¡/i¿'s secretions affecting bioturbators remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ¡i¿P. canaliculata¡/i¿'s secretion on ¡i¿L. hoffmeisteri¡/i¿ and ¡i¿P. akamusi¡/i¿. ¡i¿L. hoffmeisteri¡/i¿ and ¡i¿P. akamusi¡/i¿ were treated for 24 h with ¡i¿P. canaliculata¡/i¿ and the native species ¡i¿Bellamya aeruginosa¡/i¿ secretions at different densities (1 or 20). The migration numbers and aggregation rate of ¡i¿L. hoffmeisteri¡/i¿ indicated that ¡i¿P. canaliculata¡/i¿ secretion caused ¡i¿L. hoffmeisteri¡/i¿ to become alert and migrate away from the nucleus community, resulting in poor population identification, especially at high concentrations. Moreover, the antioxidant enzymatic activity, lipid peroxidation, intestinal microbial diversity, and composition of the two bioturbators were analyzed. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration were elevated following ¡i¿P. canaliculata¡/i¿ secretion treatment, indicating oxidative damage. Furthermore, the composition and diversity of intestinal microbiota of ¡i¿L. hoffmeisteri¡/i¿ and ¡i¿P. akamusi¡/i¿ were changed. The abundance of functional microbiota decreased, and pathogenic bacteria such as ¡i¿Aeromonas¡/i¿ became dominant in the intestines of both bioturbators. The current research evaluates the effects of ¡i¿P. canaliculata¡/i¿ secretion on the behavior, oxidative stress, and intestinal microbial composition and diversity of two bioturbators, providing new insights into the assessment of post-invaded ecosystems.

AB  - Emerging pathogens of honey bees represent an important threat to the development of the beekeeping sector. The implementation of biosecurity measures in beekeeping (BMBs) plays an essential role in supporting honey bee health within the beekeeping sector. A group of experts, in collaboration with the BPRACTICES (Grant Agreement No. 696231, European Research Area on Sustainable Animal Production Systems [ERA-Net SusAn]) project partners, has provided the definition of BMBs. Thus, BMBs are all those operational activities implemented to control the risk of introduction and spread of specific honey bee disease agents. In this paper, the BMBs in the European beekeeping context are identified for the most relevant honey bee diseases in Europe: varroosis, American foulbrood (AFB), European foulbrood (EFB), nosemosis and aethinosis. Moreover, BMBs were classified in â€˜categories' adapted to consider productivity and the â€˜One Health' approach: human health, honey bee health and protection of the environment. The 84 BMBs described by the panel of experts were ranked according to the priority score attributed. The implementation of BMBs represents an essential step forwards to increase the resilience and sustainability of European beekeeping.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The first sighting of Vespa velutina Lepeletier, 1836 var. nigrithorax du Buysson, 1905, in Spain took place in 2010 in Navarra (Castro &amp; Pagola-Carte, 2010). In 2014 came the first appearance in Asturias. It is an invasive exotic species from Asia. Since then, beekeepers in Asturias face this invasion, being the worst affected agricultural sector. Recently, in February 2018, the Provincial Action Plan was approved and measures are already being taken. This study includes both experimental and bibliographical data on V. velutina, with the intention of producing a preliminary report on the current situation of the invasion in the Principality of Asturias. There is little information regarding the behavior of this species in our ecosystems. The main objective: to broaden our knowledge of the biology and ecology of this hymenopteran in order to be able to act appropriately. There is a close relationship between temperature and the development of the Asian hornet. The worst affected municipalities in Asturias so are are Llanes, Valdés and Gijón (Figura 15). The high adaptability of queens is very remarkable, and if the optimal climatic conditions are not present, they can even extend the hibernation period (Figura 10). Different factors for involved in the distribution of V. velutina are analyzed in this article, like proximity to freshwater courses and possible attractive plants. Based on the data obtained (Figura 11), in northern Spain En 2014 se da la primera aparición en Asturias de Vespa velutina Lepeletier, 1836 var. nigrithorax du Buysson, 1905, en Asturias, especie exótica invasora procedente de Asia. Desde entonces los apicultores hacen frente a esta invasión, siendo el sector agrario más afectado.Recientemente, en febrero de 2018, se ha aprobado el Plan de Acción provincial y ya se están tomando medidas de control. En este estudio se recogen datos referentes a la V. velutina, tanto experimentales como bibliográficos, para elaborar un informe preliminar de la situación actual de la invasión en el Principado de Asturias. El principal objetivo es ampliar nuestros conocimientos sobre la biología y ecología de este himenóptero para poder actuar adecuadamente. Se observa una estrecha relación entre la temperatura y el desarrollo del avispón, pudiendo las reinas de este prolongar o acortar su hibernación en función de las temperaturas. Se analizan en este artículo diferentes factores para el desarrollo de la V. velutina: cercanía a cursos de agua dulce y posibles plantas atrayentes. Así mismo, supone un riesgo para otras especies de insectos autóctonos, tales como la abeja (Apis mellifera L. 1758) y el avispón europeo (Vespa crabro L. 1758). Con los datos de nidos es evidente el incremento poblacional en los últimos años.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - Hornets are the largest of the social wasps, and are important regulators of insect populations in their native ranges. Hornets are also very successful as invasive species, with often devastating economic, ecological and societal effects. Understanding why these wasps are such successful invaders is critical to managing future introductions and minimising impact on native biodiversity. Critical to the management toolkit is a comprehensive genomic resource for these insects. Here we provide the annotated genomes for two hornets, Vespa crabro and Vespa velutina. We compare their genomes with those of other social Hymenoptera, including the northern giant hornet Vespa mandarinia. The three hornet genomes show evidence of selection pressure on genes associated with reproduction, which might facilitate the transition into invasive ranges. Vespa crabro has experienced positive selection on the highest number of genes, including those putatively associated with molecular binding and olfactory systems. Caste-specific brain transcriptomic analysis also revealed 133 differentially expressed genes, some of which are associated with olfactory functions. This report provides a spring-board for advancing our understanding of the evolution and ecology of hornets, and opens up opportunities for using molecular methods in the future management of both native and invasive populations of these over-looked insects.

Recently, it has been reported from Hamburg, Northern Germany. Yet, the origin of this new invasion is not clear as the founders may have come either from Southern Europe or from Asia. We here use COI sequences to test these alternatives and find that the specimens from Hamburg share the same haplotype with all Southern European samples. This suggests that the species has been transported long distance from other Europe to Northern Germany and shows further its high invasion potential.¡/jats:p¿

T2  - Frontiers in allergy
AB  - Hymenoptera venom (HV) allergy can lead to life threatening conditions by specific IgE (sIgE)-mediated anaphylactic reactions. The knowledge about major allergens from venom of different clinically relevant species increased in the last decades, allowing the development of component-resolved diagnostics in which sIgE to single allergens is analysed. Despite these advances, the precise regions of the allergens that bind to IgE are only known for few HV allergens. The detailed characterization of IgE epitopes may provide valuable information to improve immunodiagnostic tests and to develop new therapeutic strategies using allergen-derived peptides or other targeted approaches. Epitope-resolved analysis is challenging, since the identification of conformational epitopes present in many allergens demands complex technologies for molecular analyses. Furthermore, functional analysis of the epitopeś interaction with their respective ligands is needed to distinguish epitopes that can activate the allergic immune response, from those that are recognized by irrelevant antibodies or T cell receptors from non-effector cells. In this review, we focus on the use of mapping and molecular targeting approaches for characterization of the epitopes of the major venom allergens of clinically relevant Hymenoptera species. The screening of the most relevant allergen peptides by epitope mapping could be helpful for the development of molecules that target major and immunodominant epitopes blocking the allergen induced cellular reactions as novel approach for the treatment of HV allergy.

AB  - Background: Subcutaneous immunotherapy with allergoid preparations (SCIT allergoids) represent the market leading application route in allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in Germany. The safety profile of SCIT allergoids is favorable and the efficacy has been proven in DBPC trials and meta analysis for various preparations. However, the treatment outcomes always reflect the effects under artificial conditions. The aim of the 'Tyrosine-Allergoid -Real World Evidence in Germany -Effectiveness in AIT" (TARGET) study program is to investigate the "effectiveness" of authorized MicroCrystalline Tyrosine (MCT)-adsorbed grass and tree pollen (pollen) SCIT allergoids in clinical practice routine. Method: TARGET is designed as a retrospective cohort study and is based on the IMS ® LRx database (IQVIA, Germany). It accesses prescription data of German patients within the statutory health insurance system (GKV). The information collected is patient related with a unique anonymized identification number, allowing a patient follow up over time. One objective of the TARGET study program is to assess the impact of authorized pollen SCIT allergoids (MCT-adsorbed allergoid, allergoid 2, allergoid 3) on allergic rhinitis (AR) patients vs. control group (patients not receiving AIT). The progression of AR is measured by the prescription of symptomatic medication.

In this study, we tested the efficacy of new attractant and on-the-market-attractant in the apiaries located in Jeonnam area. As the efficacy test result, it turned out that V. velutina was the most dominant species. The newly developed attractant showed substantially high capture of V. velutina that was statistically supported (P ¡ 0.01). On the other hand, many other insects have also been caught by the attractant, requiring further development aimed specific to V. velutina.

AB  - The association of pollinators with their host plants is a critical element of ecosystem functioning and one that is usually determined indirectly in the fossil record from specific morphological traits of flowers or putative pollinating animals. The exceptionally fine preservation at Messel, Germany, offers an excellent source of data on pollen from fossil flowers as well as preserved adhering to insects as direct evidence of their association with specific floral lineages. Here, we report on pollen recovered from the body and legs of a large carpenter bee (Apidae: Xylocopinae: Xylocopini) from the Eocene of Messel. The fossil is the earliest occurrence of the tribe Xylocopini and represents an extinct subgenus and species, described as ¡i¿Xylocopa¡/i¿ (¡i¿Apocolyx¡/i¿) ¡i¿primigenia¡/i¿ subgen. et sp. nov. Two eudicot pollen types were recovered from the bee, one of the family Theaceae (Asterids: Ericales) and another of Araliaceae (Euasterids: Apiales). The pollen grains are compared with various extinct and extant pollen types, and data on floral visitors to modern theaceous and araliaceous flowers are explored in relation to understanding the association of the fossil carpenter with these floral types in the paratropical Eocene biota of Messel.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿Vespa velutina is an invasive species introduced by accident into Europe. Since its entry, it has spread rapidly and become a threat to biodiversity and beekeeping. Chemical communication between hornets is one of the main reasons for the proper functioning of hornet colonies. These signals can be from endogenous and/or exogenous chemical compounds. In this work, the volatile organic compound profile of Vespa velutina larvae was obtained by GC-MS previous solvent extraction procedures. A total of 99 volatile compounds were identified in the larvae volatile profile, of which 33 were common to adult hornets, suggesting a possible endogenous origin and a functional role in physiological processes and chemical communication within the colony. A total of 42 compounds were detected exclusively in the larvae, belonging to aldehydes, alcohols, alkanes, alkenes, amines, ketones, piperidines, pyrrolidines, furanones, fatty acid esters, ethers, and pyridines chemical families. The detection of these compounds in larval stages, before environmental exposure, supports the hypothesis of their endogenous origin. The findings of this work can contribute to widening the knowledge of the biology and chemical composition of V. velutina and could help identify potential semiochemicals useful for the design of more selective and sustainable strategies for its control.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - Within the Open Science project entitled 'Botanic Garden, factory of molecules', a multidisciplinary study approach was applied to Ballota acetabulosa (L.) Benth., at the Ghirardi Botanic Garden (Toscolano Maderno, BS, Italy). Micromorphological and histochemical investigations were performed on the secreting structures of the vegetative and reproductive organs under light, fuorescence and electronic microscopy. Concurrently the characterization of the volatiles spontaneously emitted from leaves and flowers were examined. Four trichome morphotypes were identified: peltate and short-stalked, medium-stalked and long-stalked capitate trichomes, each with a specific distribution pattern. The histochemical analysis was confirmed using ultrastructural observations, with the peltates and long-stalked capitates as the main sites responsible for terpene production. The head-space characterization revealed that sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated both in leaves and flowers, with γ-muurolene, β-caryophyllene and (E)-nerolidol as the most abundant compounds. Moreover, a comparison with literature data concerning the ecological roles of the main compounds suggested their dominant roles in defence, both at the leaf and flower level. Hence, we correlated the trichome morphotypes with the production of secondary metabolites in an attempt to link these data to their potential ecological roles. Finally, we made the obtained scientific knowledge available to visitors of the Botanic Garden through the realization of new labelling dedicated to B. acetabulosa that highlights the 'invisible', microscopic features of the plant.

AB  - New information on the lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and fipronil on organisms is presented in this review, complementing the previous Worldwide Integrated Assessment (WIA) in 2015. The high toxicity of these systemic insecticides to invertebrates has been confirmed and expanded to include more species and compounds. Most of the recent research has focused on bees and the sublethal and ecological impacts these insecticides have on pollinators. Toxic effects on other invertebrate taxa also covered predatory and parasitoid natural enemies and aquatic arthropods. Little new information has been gathered on soil organisms. The impact on marine and coastal ecosystems is still largely uncharted. The chronic lethality of neonicotinoids to insects and crustaceans, and the strengthened evidence that these chemicals also impair the immune system and reproduction, highlights the dangers of this particular insecticidal class (neonicotinoids and fipronil), with the potential to greatly decrease populations of arthropods in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Sublethal effects on fish, reptiles, frogs, birds, and mammals are also reported, showing a better understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity of these insecticides in vertebrates and their deleterious impacts on growth, reproduction, and neurobehaviour of most of the species tested. This review concludes with a summary of impacts on the ecosystem services and functioning, particularly on pollination, soil biota, and aquatic invertebrate communities, thus reinforcing the previous WIA conclusions (van der Sluijs et al. 2015).

AB  - Vespa mandarinia Smith, commonly called the Asian giant hornet, is the largest hornet in the world. Its size and distinctive markings make it easily distinguishable from other Asian hornet species. Not only is the wasp occasionally life-threatening to humans, it can decimate a number of insect colonies, most notably wild and farmed honey bees. Vespa mandarinia is native to Japan and occurs in several countries in Asia. The first Vespa madarinia hornet detected in the United States was in Washington State in 2019. This 5-page fact sheet written by Caitlin Gill, Cameron Jack, and Andrea Lucky and published by the UF/IFAS Entomology and Nematology Department describes the hornet, its biology, its predatory strategies, and its medical significance. The fact sheet also provides some strategies for management of this dangerous and destructive hornet.https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in1281

TI  - Environmental niche and global potential distribution of the giant resin bee Megachile sculpturalis, a rapidly spreading invasive pollinator
AU  - Polidori, Carlo
AU  - Sánchez-Fernández, David
T2  - Global Ecology and Conservation
AB  - Abstract Since alien species may threaten native ecosystems when becoming invasive, one of the main challenges is try to predict their potential spread. Despite bees are essential pollinators and provide important ecosystem services in their native areas, outside these areas they could represent a risk for the local bee fauna, e.g. by competing for resources or by transmitting pathogens, as it was observed for species of Megachile, the bee genus with the highest number of recorded alien species. Here, using two complementary methods (Multidimensional Envelope procedure (MDE) and the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt)), we aim to explore environmental niche as well as to identify potential worldwide distribution of the giant resin bee Megachile sculpturalis, native to Asia and recently introduced in North America and Europe. The two methodological approaches predict an important expansion for the species and reveal a preference for areas of Palearctic and Nearctic regions with reduced temperature fluctuations and moderate precipitation regimes. The Southern hemisphere seems not having good conditions for this species. Estimations for the future (2070) predict a further, though limited expansion to northern areas in the North hemisphere. However, during roughly 25 years of spreading outside its native range, M. sculpturalis clearly expanded the range of inhabitable environmental conditions, which may increase its potential invasiveness in a pattern difficult to predict using only correlative methods. Physiological and ecological data are necessary to better assess the potential niche of this bee species and in consequence to better predict its future spreading dynamics.

AB  - Sacbrood virus (SBV) is a common honey bee virus disease. SBV variants and strains identified in Asian honey bees, Apis cerana, have created confusion in identifications. Although the regional names indicated the expansions of the virus in new regions, pathogenesis, and genomes of these variants are not distinct enough to be a separate virus species. However, current SBV qPCR methods may not detect newly identified A. cerana SBV variants (Ac SBV) according to the genome sequences. Since these Ac SBV can naturally infect A. mellifera and possibly other hymenopterans, ignorance of Ac SBV variants in detection methods is simply unwise. In this report, we updated the qPCR method based on Blanchard's design that used conserved regions of VP1 to design a TaqMan method with an MGB (minor groove binder) probe. We tested the method in bees and hornets, including A. mellifera, A. cerana, and Vespa velutina. The updated primers and the probe can match published SBV and Ac SBV genomes in databases, and this updated method has reasonable sensitivity and flexibility to be applied as a detection and quantification method before the discovery of variants with more mutated VP1 gene.

AB  - Current approaches to risk assessment in bees do not take into account co-exposures from multiple stressors. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is deploying resources and efforts to move towards a holistic risk assessment approach of multiple stressors in bees. This paper describes the general principles of pesticide risk assessment in bees, including recent developments at EFSA dealing with risk assessment of single and multiple pesticide residues and biological hazards. The EFSA Guidance Document on the risk assessment of plant protection products in bees highlights the need for the inclusion of an uncertainty analysis, other routes of exposures and multiple stressors such as chemical mixtures and biological agents. The EFSA risk assessment on the survival, spread and establishment of the small hive beetle, Aethina tumida, an invasive alien species, is provided with potential insights for other bee pests such as the Asian hornet, Vespa velutina. Furthermore, data gaps are identified at each step of the risk assessment, and recommendations are made for future research that could be supported under the framework of Horizon 2020. Finally, the recent work conducted at EFSA is presented, under the overarching MUST-B project ("EU efforts towards the development of a holistic approach for the risk assessment on MUltiple STressors in Bees") comprising a toolbox for harmonised data collection under field conditions and a mechanistic model to assess effects from pesticides and other stressors such as biological agents and beekeeping management practices, at the colony level and in a spatially complex landscape. Future perspectives at EFSA include the development of a data model to collate high quality data to calibrate and validate the model to be used as a regulatory tool. Finally, the evidence collected within the framework of MUST-B will support EFSA's activities on the development of a holistic approach to the risk assessment of multiple stressors in bees. In conclusion, EFSA calls for collaborative action at the EU level to establish a common and open access database to serve multiple purposes and different stakeholders.

AB  - Alarm communication is a key adaptation that helps social groups resist predation and rally defenses. In Asia, the world's largest hornet, Vespa mandarinia, and the smaller hornet, Vespa velutina, prey upon foragers and nests of the Asian honey bee, Apis cerana. We attacked foragers and colony nest entrances with these predators and provide the first evidence, in social insects, of an alarm signal that encodes graded danger and attack context. We show that, like Apis mellifera, A. cerana possesses a vibrational "stop signal," which can be triggered by predator attacks upon foragers and inhibits waggle dancing. Large hornet attacks were more dangerous and resulted in higher bee mortality. Per attack at the colony level, large hornets elicited more stop signals than small hornets. Unexpectedly, stop signals elicited by large hornets (SS large hornet) had a significantly higher vibrational fundamental frequency than those elicited by small hornets (SS small hornet) and were more effective at inhibiting waggle dancing. Stop signals resulting from attacks upon the nest entrance (SS nest) were produced by foragers and guards and were significantly longer in pulse duration than stop signals elicited by attacks upon foragers (SS forager). Unlike SS forager, SS nest were targeted at dancing and non-dancing foragers and had the common effect, tuned to hornet threat level, of inhibiting bee departures from the safe interior of the nest. Meanwhile, nest defenders were triggered by the bee alarm pheromone and live hornet presence to heat-ball the hornet. In A. cerana, sophisticated recruitment communication that encodes food location, the waggle dance, is therefore matched with an inhibitory/alarm signal that encodes information about the context of danger and its threat level.

AB  - The increase in invasive alien species is a concern for the environment. The establishment of some of these species may be changing the balance between pathogenicity and host factors, which could alter the defense strategies of native host species. Vespid species are among the most successful invasive animals, such as the genera ¡i¿Vespa¡/i¿, ¡i¿Vespula¡/i¿ and ¡i¿Polistes¡/i¿. Bee viruses have been extensively studied as an important cause of honey bee population losses. However, knowledge about the transmission of honey bee viruses in Vespids is a relevant and under-researched aspect. The role of some mites such as ¡i¿Varroa¡/i¿ in the transmission of honey bee viruses is clearer than in the case of Vespidae. This type of transmission by vectors has not yet been clarified in Vespidae, with interspecific relationships being the main hypotheses accepted for the transmission of bee viruses. A majority of studies describe the presence of viruses or their replicability, but aspects such as the symptomatology in Vespids or the ability to infect other hosts from Vespids are scarcely discussed. Highlighting the case of ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ as an invader, which is causing huge losses in European beekeeping, is of special interest. The pressure caused by ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ leads to weakened hives that become susceptible to pathogens. Gathering this information is necessary to promote further research on the spread of bee viruses in ecosystems invaded by invasive species of Vespids, as well as to prevent the decline of bee populations due to bee viruses.

AB  - Asian honeybees use an impressive array of strategies to protect nests from hornet attacks, although little is understood about how antipredator signals coordinate defences. We compared vibroacoustic signalling and defensive responses of Apis cerana colonies that were attacked by either the group-hunting giant hornet Vespa soror or the smaller, solitary-hunting hornet Vespa velutina. Apis cerana colonies produced hisses, brief stop signals and longer pipes under hornet-free conditions. However, hornet-attack stimuli-and V. soror workers in particular-triggered dramatic increases in signalling rates within colonies. Soundscapes were cacophonous when V. soror predators were directly outside of nests, in part because of frenetic production of antipredator pipes, a previously undescribed signal. Antipredator pipes share acoustic traits with alarm shrieks, fear screams and panic calls of primates, birds and meerkats. Workers making antipredator pipes exposed their Nasonov gland, suggesting the potential for multimodal alarm signalling that warns nestmates about the presence of dangerous hornets and assembles workers for defence. Concurrent observations of nest entrances showed an increase in worker activities that support effective defences against giant hornets. Apis cerana workers flexibly employ a diverse alarm repertoire in response to attack attributes, mirroring features of sophisticated alarm calling in socially complex vertebrates.

AB  - The yellow crazy ant, ¡i¿Anoplolepis gracilipes¡/i¿ is a widespread invasive ant that poses significant threats to local biodiversity. Yet, compared to other global invasive ant species such as the red imported fire ant (¡i¿Solenopsis invicta¡/i¿) or the Argentine ant (¡i¿Linepithema humile¡/i¿), little is known about the diversity of RNA viruses in the yellow crazy ant. In the current study, we generated a transcriptomic database for ¡i¿A¡/i¿. ¡i¿gracilipes¡/i¿ using a high throughput sequencing approach to identify new RNA viruses and characterize their genomes. Four virus species assigned to ¡i¿Dicistroviridae¡/i¿, two to ¡i¿Iflaviridae¡/i¿, one to ¡i¿Polycipiviridae¡/i¿, and two unclassified ¡i¿Riboviria¡/i¿ viruses were identified. Detailed genomic characterization was carried out on the polycipivirus and revealed that this virus comprises 11,644 nucleotides with six open reading frames. Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise amino acid identity comparison classified this virus into the genus ¡i¿Sopolycivirus¡/i¿ under ¡i¿Polycipiviridae¡/i¿, which is tentatively named "¡i¿Anoplolepis gracilipes¡/i¿ virus 3 (AgrV-3)". Evolutionary analysis showed that AgrV-3 possesses a high level of genetic diversity and elevated mutation rate, combined with the common presence of multiple viral strains within single worker individuals, suggesting AgrV-3 likely evolves following the quasispecies model. A subsequent field survey placed the viral pathogen "hotspot" of ¡i¿A. gracilipes¡/i¿ in the Southeast Asian region, a pattern consistent with the region being recognized as part of the ant's native range. Lastly, infection of multiple virus species seems prevalent across field colonies and may have been linked to the ant's social organization.

T2  - Insects
AB  - Investigating the distributions of invasive species in marginal habitats can give clues to the factors constraining invasive spread. Vespula germanica is the most widely distributed of all the invasive Vespids, which in the Southern Hemisphere typically have large extensive invasive populations. In contrast, the invasion into South Africa has been slow and is still confined to a small geographic area. Here we analyse the distribution of all recent nest records in South Africa (n = 405). The distance to main rivers, mean annual rainfall, summer normalised difference moisture index (NDMI) values, and mean annual temperatures (average, minimum, maximum, and summer maximum temperature) was measured for every nest. We find that value ranges of these variables are different between the value ranges recorded for nests, the general distribution area of the wasp, and the area of absence. Optimised Hot Spot Analysis was used to quantify spatial structure in the measured climatic variables. Generally, factors related to moisture stress set the environmental limits of V. germanica’s landscape distribution. Due to the strong preference of nesting sites close to river courses, for higher rainfall conditions, medium to medium-high NDMI values, and lower mean annual temperatures, it is unlikely that V. germanica will be able to spread uniformly where it is currently found in South Africa.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 gene confirms their European origin and definitely identifies them as V. velutina. The detection in Hungary represented the species' farthest documented occurrence from its established European distribution at that time, highlighting its significant dispersal potential. Given the high density of bee populations in the region, particular attention should be paid to control efforts during the early stages of colonization.

AB  - A new hornet was detected in France a few years ago. This alien species (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) imported from Asia, has rapidly spread from South-West of France. It attacks insects and particularly honeybees whose colonies are sometimes destroyed, but it is generally not so aggressive towards humans. Nevertheless, it constitutes a risk for patients who are allergic to hymenoptera venom. However, the risk level has not yet been estimated. # 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Advanced component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) in Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) has improved the precise description of individual sensitization profiles. However, diagnostic gaps, peptide-based cross-reactivity, early identification of severe reactors and diagnosis of patients with a clear history of sting reactions but negative specific IgE and skin tests, remain challenging. Systematic literature search in PubMed and critical analysis of recently published studies on insect venom allergy diagnostics. CRD has increased the sensitivity of IgE testing and improved the discrimination of primary sensitization from irrelevant cross-reactivity, ultimately providing a better rationale for therapeutic decisions. Despite these major advances, there is still room for improvement in routine HVA diagnostics. Peptide based cross-reactivity among homologous allergens from Vespinae and Polistinae venoms as well as still existing diagnostic gaps are particularly challenging. No marker allergens are currently available to differentiate Vespula and Polistes sensitizations. Several strategies including clinical setting of basophil activation test (BAT) for routine diagnostics, venomic analysis for the identification of novel allergens and characterization of the molecular basis of cross-reactivity could be used to address major limitations and unresolved issues in molecular diagnostics of HVA.

AB  - For the last twenty years, the mortality of honeybee colonies has been increasing and is now a major concern for biologists. There have been a number of hypotheses put forth in the literature, including hives' infestation with parasites like Varroa destructor, the appearance of new predators like Asian hornets (Vespa Velutina) or small hive beetles and widespread use of pesticides. In addition, climate and environmental changes are modifying the honeybee's interaction with its ecosystem. Last works suggest that this mortality could be due not to a single reason, but to a convergence of stress factors. This article presents the development of an experimental platform dedicated to track the honeybee colony (Apis mellifera) health in parallel with the quantification of the main environmental stressors. Our main objective is to provide biologists with a paraphernalia that is primarily based on motion analyses with different sensors inside and outside the hive for the study of bees' behavior at both individual (the bee) as well as a colony (the superorganism) scales. The aim is to create a reference dataset of behaviors associated with environmental factors in both normal and stressful environments.

Vespa velutina nigrithorax is an invasive alien wasp species that is currently dominating in East Asia and Europe, bringing huge economic damages. As a control over alien species is made when the valuable utilization of the invasive species as a potential resource are discovered, investigations on the potential of V. v. nigrithorax as a useful bioresource are also in demand. Nutritional and heavy metal analyses of the larvae revealed their balanced and rich nutritional value and safety as a food resource. The larval saliva amino acid composition was investigated for further study on amino acid supplementation and exercise enhancement.

AB  - Hornets and honey bees have a long history of coevolution resulting in a plethora of captivating adaptations and counteradaptations between predator and prey. From simple physiological mechanisms to complex behavioral strategies, some Vespa hornets have specialized in hunting honey bees, while the latter have put in place effective defenses to counteract their attack. Both hornets and honey bees have evolved the ability to detect the odors and the pheromones emitted by the other to locate the prey or to spot foraging predators. Hornets often rely on their bigger size, heavily armored body and destructive attacks, while honey bees differentiated collective defense responses finely coordinated to deter or kill the hornet menace. However, when new species of hornets and honey bees come into contact, the absence of coevolution can have a heavy impact on the defenseless bees. The evolutionary arms race between hornets and honey bees provides not only compelling examples of adaptations and counteradaptations between predator and prey, but could also represent a starting point for the development of effective and sustainable strategies to protect honey bees and beekeeping activities and to control invasive alien species of hornets.

AB  - High winter mortality of honey bees (¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿) has been observed in temperate regions over the past 30 years. Several biotic and abiotic stressors associated with winter colony losses have been identified, but the mechanisms and interactions underlying their effects remain unclear. We reviewed the effects of stressors on key overwintering biological traits, distinguishing between individual and colony traits. We found that disturbances at the level of individual traits can be amplified when transmitted to colony traits. By analyzing these cascading effects, we propose a concept of a feedback loop mechanism of winter mortality. We found that population size, social thermoregulation and honey reserve are integrative traits and can predict overwintering failure. Furthermore, we identified social thermoregulation as a good candidate for an early warning indicator. We therefore discuss existing tools for monitoring hive temperature to help mitigate the current high winter mortality of honey bees and support the sustainability of beekeeping.

AB  - The invasive hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax is considered a proliferating threat to pollinators in Europe and Asia. While the impact of this species on managed honey bees is well-documented, effects upon other pollinator populations remain poorly understood. Nonetheless, dietary analyses indicate that the hornets consume a diversity of prey, fuelling concerns for at-risk taxa. Here, we quantify the impact of V. velutina upon standardised commercially-reared colonies of the European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris terrestris. Using a landscape-scale experimental design, we deploy colonies across a gradient of local V. velutina densities, utilising automated tracking to non-invasively observe bee and hornet behaviour, and quantify subsequent effects upon colony outcomes. Our results demonstrate that hornets frequently hunt at B. terrestris colonies, being preferentially attracted to those with high foraging traffic, and engaging in repeated-yet entirely unsuccessful-predation attempts at nest entrances. Notably however, we show that B. terrestris colony weights are negatively associated with local V. velutina densities, indicating potential indirect effects upon colony growth. Taken together, these findings provide the first empirical insight into impacts on bumblebees at the colony level, and inform future mitigation efforts for wild and managed pollinators.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The ever-increasing number of introduced species profoundly threatens global biodiversity. While the ecological and evolutionary consequences of invasive alien species are receiving increasing attention, their economic impacts have largely remained understudied, especially in France. Here, we aimed at providing a general overview of the monetary losses (damages caused by) and expenditures (management of) associated with invasive alien species in France. This country has a long history of alien species presence, partly due to its long-standing global trade activities, highly developed tourism, and presence of overseas territories in different regions of the globe, resulting in a conservative minimum of 2,750 introduced and invasive alien species. By synthesizing for the first time the monetary losses and expenditures incurred by invasive alien species in Metropolitan France and French overseas territories, we obtained 1,583 cost records for 98 invasive alien species. We found that they caused a conservative total amount ranging between US1,280millionand11,535millionincostsovertheperiod1993–2018.WeextrapolatedcostsforspeciesinvadingFrance,forwhichcostswerereportedinothercountriesbutnotinFrance,whichyieldedanadditionalcostrangingfromUS 151 to 3,030 millions.

AB  - The Asian hornet, Vespa velutina, is an invasive, globally-distributed predator of European honey bees and other insects. To better under its reproductive biology and to find a specific, effective, and low-impact control method for this species, we identified and tested the key compounds in V. velutina sex pheromone. Virgin gynes (reproductive females) produced this sex pheromone in the sixth intersegmental sternal glands of their abdomens. The active compounds were 4-oxo-octanoic acid (4-OOA, 10.4 μg bee-1) and 4-oxo-decanoic acid (4-ODA, 13.3 μg bee-1) at a 0.78 ratio of 4-OOA/4-ODA. We synthesized these compounds and showed that male antennae were highly sensitive to them. Moreover, males were only strongly attracted to a 4-OOA/4-ODA blend at the natural ratio produced by gynes. These results provide the first demonstration of an effective way to lure V. velutina males, and the first chemical identification of a sex pheromone in the eusocial hornets.

AB  - Vespa velutina is a predatory hornet distributing in SouthEastern part of Asia and became invasive in early 2000s; invading into Korea in 2003 and France in 2004. Its distribution pattern showed typical species-invasion curve type with slow progress in the beginning and rapid expansion on ward. We determined the geographic spread of V. velutina with CLIMEX modeling. The model analysis indicates that the ecoclimatic indices (EI) increased as the projection year increased based on RCP8.5 scenario. Then the predicted EI values were further regressed with the field collected data from 2018. Vespa velutina population sizes were estimated from 230 points of sampling over the country and the sampling data were correlated with predicted EI values. The results indicated that partial contribution of the climate factors for its abundance. Also this could be an usual biological indicator of climate change in agroecosystem in Korea. Given the important risk and impact on beekeeping, socio-biological as well as ecosystem and biodiversity levels, careful monitoring of phenology, range expansion and preventive efforts mitigating the impact are further required.

AB  - The deformed wing virus (DWV) is one of the most common honey bee pathogens. The virus may also be detected in other insect species, including Bombus terrestris adults from wild and managed colonies. In this study, individuals of all stages, castes, and sexes were sampled from three commercial colonies exhibiting the presence of deformed workers and analysed for the presence of DWV. Adults (deformed individuals, gynes, workers, males) had their head exscinded from the rest of the body and the two parts were analysed separately by RT-PCR. Juvenile stages (pupae, larvae, and eggs) were analysed undissected. All individuals tested positive for replicative DWV, but deformed adults showed a higher number of copies compared to asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, they showed viral infection in their heads. Sequence analysis indicated that the obtained DWV amplicons belonged to a strain isolated in the United Kingdom. Further studies are needed to characterize the specific DWV target organs in the bumblebees. The result of this study indicates the evidence of DWV infection in B. terrestris specimens that could cause wing deformities, suggesting a relationship between the deformities and the virus localization in the head. Further studies are needed to define if a specific organ could be a target in symptomatic bumblebees.

AB  - The increasing development of edible insect flours as alternative sources of proteins added to food and feed products for improving their nutritional value, necessitates an accurate evaluation of their possible adverse side-effects, especially for individuals suffering from food allergies. Using a proteomic- and bioinformatic-based approach, the diversity of proteins occurring in currently consumed edible insects such as silkworm (Bombyx mori), cricket (Acheta domesticus), African migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus), and giant milworm beetle (Zophobas atratus), was investigated. Most of them consist of phylogenetically-related protein allergens widely distributed in the different groups of arthropods (mites, insects, crustaceans) and mollusks. However, a few proteins belonging to discrete protein families including the chemosensory protein, hexamerin, and the odorant-binding protein, emerged as proteins highly specific for edible insects. To a lesser extent, other proteins such as apolipophorin III, the larval cuticle protein, and the receptor for activated protein kinase, also exhibited a rather good specificity for edible insects. These proteins, that are apparently missing or much less represented in other groups of arthropods, mollusks and nematods, share well conserved amino acid sequences and very similar three-dimensional structures. Owing to their ability to trigger allergic responses in sensitized people, they should be used as probes for the specific detection of insect proteins as food ingredients in various food products and thus, to assess their food safety, especially for people allergic to edible insects.

The appearance of new species of hymenoptera that are potentially allergenic in Spain and the associated diagnostic and therapeutic problems are also described. Finally, we analyze the issue of mast cell activation syndrome closely related to hymenoptera allergy, which has become a new diagnostic challenge for allergists given its high prevalence in patients with venom anaphylaxis.

The foraging behaviour of insects, such as the invasive hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax, introduced into northwestern Spain over a decade ago, may be influenced by floral volatiles. This hornet detects plant secondary metabolites, including semiochemicals, which aid in locating nectar, carbohydrates, prey, mating sites, and other resources. Understanding the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants visited by V. velutina may help to develop targeted control strategies. The aim of this study was to identify and analyse the volatile compounds emitted by 18 plant species frequented by V. velutina nigrithorax in the province of Ourense, northwest Spain. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used in this study. A total of 110 VOCs were identified, of which 21 compounds were abundant in the samples, with terpenes being the most abundant. Furthermore, a PLS-DA analysis selected 33 volatile compounds with variable importance scores (VIPs) greater than 1, in particular methylanthranilate with a value of 1.81. Eleven of these compounds were found to be abundant in the analysed samples, including (Z)-β-ocimene; 1-octen-3-ol; 3-hexen-1-ol, acetate, (Z)-; 3-octanone; eugenol; linalool; methyl salicylate; o-cymene; α-farnesene; α-terpineol and β-farnesene. The selection of these compounds provides valuable insights into plant-insect interactions, highlighting their diverse roles as plant volatiles in mediating insect behaviour and underlining their potential as targets for environmentally friendly pest management strategies.

AB  - The Asian yellow-legged hornet Vespa velutina is an invasive alien species introduced and widespread in several countries of Europe and Asia. Its diffusion generates relevant environmental and socio-economic impacts. Environmental impacts include threats to the native insect biodiversity and the pollination ecosystem services. Socio-economic impacts include threats to the apiculture sector, economic consequences for the adoption of management strategies, social concern, and health issues. Different options were developed and adopted for i) preventing the introduction of V. velutina, ii) early detecting its presence, iii) eradicating populations at the initial stage of invasion or iv) controlling populations for limiting and mitigating its impacts. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview about the distribution, impacts, and options for managing V. velutina populations, through a literature review of the published academic documents. Moreover, this study highlights that some topics (impacts of V. velutina on the biodiversity, on the pollination ecosystem services, on the economy) received little research attention than other topics, and future research should be directed toward filling these gaps of knowledge.

AB  - Social insects are successful animal invaders. Their survival and success, and in some cases also their impact on invaded ecosystem functioning, is often mediated by symbiosis with microorganisms. Here, we report a comprehensive comparative characterization of the gut microbial communities of different castes and developmental stages of the invasive hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax. The species recently colonized Europe, becoming a high ecological and economic concern, as it threatens pollinator survival and competes with native hornet species. We used targeted meta-genomics to describe the yeasts and bacteria gut communities of individuals of different reproductive phenotypes (workers and future queens), life stages (larvae, newly emerged individuals and adults) and colony non-living samples (nest paper and larval faeces). Bacilli, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant classes of bacteria, and Saccharomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Tremellomycetes and Eurotiomycetes were the most represented yeast classes. We found that the microbial compositions significantly differ across developmental stages and castes, with yeast and bacterial communities switching in frequency and abundance during ontogeny and according to reproductive phenotype. Moreover, the gut microbial communities poorly mirror those found in the nest, suggesting that hornets possess a specific microbial signature. Our results provide the first metagenomic resource of the microbiome of V. velutina in Europe and suggest the importance of considering life stages, reproductive phenotypes and nest influence in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of social insect microbial communities.

AB  - Knowledge regarding the honey bee pathogens borne by invasive bee pests remains scarce. This investigation aimed to assess the presence in Aethina tumida (small hive beetle, SHB) adults of honey bee pathogens belonging to the following groups: (i) bacteria (Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius), (ii) trypanosomatids (Lotmaria passim and Crithidia mellificae), and (iii) viruses (black queen cell virus, Kashmir bee virus, deformed wing virus, slow paralysis virus, sacbrood virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus, acute bee paralysis virus, chronic bee paralysis virus). Specimens were collected from free-flying colonies in Gainesville (Florida, USA) in summer 2017. The results of the molecular analysis show the presence of L. passim, C. mellificae, and replicative forms of deformed wing virus (DWV) and Kashmir bee virus (KBV). Replicative forms of KBV have not previously been reported. These results support the hypothesis of pathogen spillover between managed honey bees and the SHB, and these dynamics require further investigation.

The species can cause serious damage to ecosystem biodiversity and in areas where it has been introduced, and can have serious impacts over beekeeping. Bioclimatic modelling suggests that under current climate conditions representatives of the invasive species have chances in the near term to invade a number of regions in Ukraine, especially in the west of the country, including Transcarpathia, and Crimea.

T2  - Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - Drastic declines in insect populations are a vital concern worldwide. Despite widespread insect monitoring, the significant gaps in the literature must be addressed. Future monitoring techniques must be systematic and global. Advanced technologies and computer solutions are needed. We provide here a review of relevant works to show the high potential for solving the aforementioned problems. Major historical and modern methods of insect monitoring are considered. All major radar solutions are carefully reviewed. Insect monitoring with radar is a well established technique, but it is still a fast-growing topic. The paper provides an updated classification of insect radar sets. Three main groups of insect radar solutions are distinguished: scanning, vertical-looking, and harmonic. Pulsed radar sets are utilized for all three groups, while frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) systems are applied only for vertical-looking and harmonic insect radar solutions. This work proves the high potential of radar entomology based on the growing research interest, along with the emerging novel setups, compact devices, and data processing approaches. The review exposes promising insect monitoring solutions using compact radar instruments. The proposed compact and resource-effective setups can be very beneficial for systematic insect monitoring.

AB  - As a signature of reproductive interference (RI), we reviewed hybrid production in eusocial bumblebees in Japan, by comparing introduced Bombus terrestris with native B. ignitus in Honshu (main island of Japan) and with native B. hypocrita sapporoensis in Hokkaido (northern island of Japan). In this review, we present additional new data showing hybrid production between introduced B. terrestris and native B. ignitus in Honshu. Interspecific mating with introduced B. terrestris disrupts the reproduction of native B. h. sapporoensis and B. ignitus, which belong to the same subgenus of Bombus, through inviable egg production. This interference appears to facilitate species replacement on Hokkaido. Simultaneously, the mating frequencies for queens of B. terrestris have increased, suggesting that polyandry might evolve in response to the extent of RI between B. terrestris and B. h. sapporoensis. To suppress the population size of B. terrestris in Hokkaido, two methods have been proposed: the mass release of B. h. sapporoensis males to induce RI between the two species and the spraying of insecticides against foraging workers so that the workers will carry the insecticides back to their colonies, killing the immature bees within the colonies. A candidate insecticide type is insect growth regulator, which may disrupt larval development without any apparent effect on foraging workers.

AB  - Understanding how vectors alter the interactions between viruses and their hosts is a fundamental question in virology and disease ecology. In honey bees, transmission of deformed wing virus (DWV) by parasitic Varroa mites has been associated with elevated disease and host mortality, and Varroa transmission has been hypothesized to lead to increased viral titres or select for more virulent variants. Here, we mimicked Varroa transmission by serially passaging a mixed population of two DWV variants, A and B, by injection through in vitro reared honey bee pupae and tracking these viral populations through five passages. The DWV-A and DWV-B variant proportions shifted dynamically through passaging, with DWV-B outcompeting DWV-A after one passage, but levels of both variants becoming equivalent by Passage 5. Sequencing analysis revealed a dominant, recombinant DWV-B strain (DWV-A derived 5' IRES region with the rest of the genome DWV-B), with low nucleotide diversity that decreased through passaging. DWV-A populations had higher nucleotide diversity compared to DWV-B, but this also decreased through passaging. Selection signatures were found across functional regions of the DWV-A and DWV-B genomes, including amino acid mutations in the putative capsid protein region. Simulated vector transmission differentially impacted two closely related viral variants which could influence viral interactions with the host, demonstrating surprising plasticity in vector-host-viral dynamics.

AB  - Vespa velutina, one of the most aggressive and fearful wasps in China, can cause grievous allergies and toxic reactions, leading to organ failure and even death. However, there is little evidence on molecular data regarding wasps. Therefore, we aimed to provide an insight into the transcripts expressed in the venom gland of wasps. In our study, high-throughput RNA sequencing was performed using the venom glands of four wasp species. First, the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase submit I (COI) barcoding and the neighbor joining (NJ) tree were used to validate the unique identity and lineage of each individual species. After sequencing, a total of 127,630 contigs were generated and 98,716 coding domain sequences (CDS) were predicted from the four species. The Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of unigenes revealed their functional role in important biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MF) and cellular components (CC). In addition, c-type, p1 type, p2 type and p3 type were the most commonly found simple sequence repeat (SSR) types in the four species of wasp transcriptome. There were differences in the distribution of SSRs and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the four wasp species. The transcriptome data generated in this study will improve our understanding on bioactive proteins and venom-related genes in wasp venom gland and provide a basis for pests control and other applications. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the identification of large-scale genomic data and the discovery of microsatellite markers from V. tropica ducalis and V. analis fabricius.

However, the anti-obesity effects of ¡i¿Nidus vespae¡/i¿ extract (NV) have not yet been reported. This study aimed to elucidate the potential anti-obesity effects of NV in vivo and in vitro, using a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, respectively. NV administration to HFD-induced obese mice significantly decreased the mass and plasma lipid content of adipose tissues. Uncoupling protein-1 expression was significantly higher in the inguinal white adipose tissues of NV-treated mice than in those of HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, we found that NV inhibited the differentiation and intracellular lipid accumulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes by regulating the insulin signaling cascade, including protein kinase B, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, and adiponectin. These findings suggest that NV may exhibit therapeutic effects against obesity by suppressing adipose tissue expansion and preadipocyte differentiation, thereby providing critical information for the development of new drugs for disease prevention and treatment. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of the anti-obesity effects of NV.

AB  - The German wasp (Vespula germanica) is a highly successful invader on a global scale. These wasps were first observed in the Western Cape region in South Africa in 1972, and they have the potential to expand their range and cause significant damage to the native biodiversity. Our study used nuclear (DNA microsatellites) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 42 wasp colonies to analyse the population genetics of V. germanica in their invaded South African range. We sequenced three mitochondrial genes; cytochrome c oxidase I, cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase II. We found six mtDNA haplotypes present in South Africa. Although only a single fertilized queen is sufficient for the establishment of a wasp nest, the probability of a single introduced queen to successfully establish a nest and a population is very small. If multiple queens were introduced at the same time, the probability for more than one haplotype being transferred to the new population increases. Therefore, the true number of queen introductions occurred in South Africa can be inferred to be between two and six. We examined nine microsatellite loci and found weak-to-no genetic sub-structuring, likely due to high dispersal rates. We concluded that German wasps in South Africa maintain a homogenous population with movement of individuals between localities.

AB  - The BEEBOOK project arose from discussions at early COLOSS (Prevention of Honey Bee COlony LOSSes) meetings. The vision was, and still is, to develop a definitive inventory of standard techniques and methods in honey bee research to ensure that studies performed by different laboratories around the world would be directly comparable. The manual, titled the COLOSS BEEBOOK, was inspired by publications with similar purposes for Drosophila fruit fly research (Williams et al., 2012) . The previous lack of standards had made, for example, establishing whether honey bee colony losses had indeed increased, or were greater in some countries than in others, exceptionally difficult. The BEEBOOK is not meant to standardize the research itself, but focusses solely on the methods for which standardization is useful to enable reproducibility as a cornerstone of science. The BEEBOOK is a tool for all who want to conduct research on honey bees. It has been written in such a way that those new to honey bee research can use it to begin studies in fields with which they may not be familiar.

AB  - ¡title¿Abstract¡/title¿ ¡p¿Ecological niche models have proved to be a powerful tool in assessing invasiveness risk of alien species, allowing the optimization of control strategies. ¡italic¿Vespa velutina¡/italic¿ (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) is an invasive species with strong ecological, economical and health impacts in Europe after it first report in France in 2004. It was detected for the first time in a Mediterranean island (Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain) in 2015, where a single nest was found in the northwest of the island. Immediately a control plan was implemented. In this study, we analysed 30 occurrence data in Mallorca island to assess the suitability distribution predicted to Mediterranean island conditions using ensemble of small models. We obtained high values of AUC (0.9165), Somers’ D (0.8331), Boyce (0.7611) and TSS (0.7754) as quality parameters of the final ensembled model. We show for the first time that there are suitable areas where this species can expand and stablish, mainly in steeper slopes and low isothermality zones. Likewise, the distribution suitability of ¡italic¿V. velutina¡/italic¿ for other Mediterranean islands (Ibiza, Formentera, Menorca, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete and Cyprus) was also explored, showing potentially suitable zones. This study provides valuable information regarding the areas in the Mediterranean islands under risk of invasion, and it could be used by both scientists and managers for an early detection and control of the invasive species due to its cost-effectiveness in terms of conservation.¡/p¿

AB  - ¡i¿Camellia oleifera¡/i¿ Abel. is an important woody oil plant, and its pollination success is essential for oil production. We conducted this study to select the best pollinator candidates for ¡i¿C. oleifera¡/i¿ using principal component analysis and multi-attribute decision-making. Field observations of the flower-visiting characteristics of candidate pollinators were conducted at three sites. The insect species that visited flowers did not considerably differ between regions or time periods. However, the proportion of each species recorded did vary. We recorded eleven main candidates from two orders and six families at the three sites. The pollen amount carried by ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿ was significantly higher than that of other insects. However, the visit frequency and body length of ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿ were smaller than those of ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿. Statistical analysis showed that ¡i¿A. mellifera¡/i¿ is the best candidate pollinator; ¡i¿Eristalis¡/i¿¡i¿cerealis¡/i¿ is a good candidate pollinator; ¡i¿Phytomia zonata¡/i¿, ¡i¿A. cerana,¡/i¿ and ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ were ordinary candidate pollinators; and four fly species, ¡i¿Episyrphus balteatus¡/i¿, and ¡i¿Eristalinus arvorum¡/i¿ were classified as inefficient candidate pollinators. Our study shows that flies and hoverflies play an important role in the pollination system. Given the global decline in bee populations, the role of flies should also be considered in ¡i¿C. oleifera¡/i¿ seed production.

T2  - NeoBiota : advancing research on alien species and biological invasions
AB  - Since its accidental introduction in 2003 in France, the yellow-legged Asian hornet Vespa velutina ni-grithorax is rapidly spreading through France and Europe. Economic assessments regarding the costs of invasive species often reveal important costs from required control measures or damages. Despite the rapid invasion of the Asian yellow-legged hornet in Europe and potential damage to apiculture and pollination services, the costs of its invasion have not been evaluated yet. Here we aimed at studying the costs arising from the Asian yellow-legged hornet invasion by providing the first estimate of the control cost. Today, the invasion of the Asian yellow-legged hornet is mostly controlled by nest destruction. We estimated that nest destruction cost €23 million between 2006 and 2015 in France. The yearly cost is increasing as the species keeps spreading and could reach €11.9 million in France, €9.0 million in Italy and €8.6 million in the United Kingdom if the species fills its current climatically suitable distribution. Although more work will be needed to estimate the cost of the Asian yellow-legged hornet on apiculture and pollination services, they likely exceed the current costs of control with nest destruction. It could thus be worth increasing control efforts by aiming at destroying a higher percentage of nests.

AB  - (1) Background: Dipeptidyl Peptidases IV (DPPIVs), present in many organisms, are minor components in the venoms of Hymenoptera, where they have been identified as cross-reactive allergenic molecules. Considering that the structure of homologous DPPIVs is well characterized, we aimed to explain which regions have higher similarity among these proteins and present a comparison among them, including a new ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ DPPIV sequence. Moreover, two cases of sensitization to DPPIVs in wasp- and honeybee-sensitized patients are presented. (2) Methods: Proteomic analyses have been performed on the venom of the Asian hornet ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ to demonstrate the sequence of its DPPIV (allergen named Vesp v 3, with sequence accession number P0DRB8, and with the proteomic data available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD046030). A comparison performed through their alignments and analysis of the three-dimensional structure showed a region with higher similarity among Hymenoptera DPPIVs. Additionally, ImmunoCAP™ determinations (including specific inhibition experiments), as well as IgE immunoblotting, are performed to demonstrate the allergenicity of Api m 5 and Ves v 3. (3) Results and Conclusions: The data presented demonstrate that the similarities among Hymenoptera DPPIVs are most likely localized at the C-terminal region of these enzymes. In addition, a higher similarity of the ¡i¿Vespa¡/i¿/¡i¿Vespula¡/i¿ DPPIVs is shown. The clinical cases analyzed demonstrated the allergenicity of Api m 5 and Ves v 3 in the sera of the allergic patients, as well as the presence of this minor component in the preparations used in venom immunotherapy.

Polistes associus Kohl, Polistes dominula (Christ), Polistes gallicus (L.), Polistes nimpha (Christ), Vespa crabro L., Vespa velutina Lepeletier, Vespula germanica (F.), Vespula vulgaris (L.), and Dolichovespula media (Retzius) were trapped for a total of 5,077 specimens in the period 2007-2012. V. velutina was captured at Loano (Liguria) for the first time in Italy by means of a yellow cap trap filled with beer. V. crabro, V. germanica and V. vulgaris were the most abundant species in the social wasp communities studied. Beer in clear, colourless and transparent, 1.5 l polyethylene bottles with yellow and white coloured caps was a good bait-trap combinations for all social wasp species, while it trapped only some Bombus terrestris (L.) specimens. A white cap trap filled with commercial mint syrup solution was a good combination for trapping Bombus argillaceus (Scopoli) and a yellow cap trap filled with a solution of vinegar, sugar and honey was the best combination for trapping Apis mellifera L.

AB  - Insect pollinators provide major pollination services for wild plants and crops. Honeybee viruses can cause serious damage to honeybee colonies. However, viruses of other wild pollinating insects have yet to be fully explored. In the present study, we used RNA sequencing to investigate the viral diversity of 50 species of wild pollinating insects. A total of 3 pathogenic honeybee viruses, 8 previously reported viruses, and 26 novel viruses were identified in sequenced samples. Among these, 7 novel viruses were shown to be closely related to honeybee pathogenic viruses, and 4 were determined to have potential pathogenicity for their hosts. The viruses detected in wild insect pollinators were mainly from the order ¡i¿Picornavirales¡/i¿ and the families ¡i¿Orthomyxoviridae¡/i¿, ¡i¿Sinhaliviridae¡/i¿, ¡i¿Rhabdoviridae¡/i¿, and ¡i¿Flaviviridae¡/i¿.

AB  - espanolEn 2014 se da la primera aparicion en Asturias de Vespa velutina Lepeletier, 1836 var. nigrithorax du Buysson, 1905, en Asturias, especie exotica invasora procedente de Asia. Desde entonces los apicultores hacen frente a esta invasion, siendo el sector agrario mas afectado. Recientemente, en febrero de 2018, se ha aprobado el Plan de Accion provincial y ya se estan tomando medidas de control. En este estudio se recogen datos referentes a la V. velutina, tanto experimentales como bibliograficos, para elaborar un informe preliminar de la situacion actual de la invasion en el Principado de Asturias. El principal objetivo es ampliar nuestros conocimientos sobre la biologia y ecologia de este himenoptero para poder actuar adecuadamente. Se observa una estrecha relacion entre la temperatura y el desarrollo del avispon, pudiendo las reinas de este prolongar o acortar su hibernacion en funcion de las temperaturas. Se analizan en este articulo diferentes factores para el desarrollo de la V. velutina: cercania a cursos de agua dulce y posibles plantas atrayentes. Asi mismo, supone un riesgo para otras especies de insectos autoctonos, tales como la abeja (Apis mellifera L. 1758) y el avispon europeo (Vespa crabro L. 1758). Con los datos de nidos es evidente el incremento poblacional en los ultimos anos EnglishThe first sighting of Vespa velutina Lepeletier, 1836 var. nigrithorax du Buysson, 1905, in Spain took place in 2010 in Navarra (Castro & Pagola-Car te, 2010). In 2014 came the first appearance in Asturias. It is an invasive exotic species from Asia. Since then, beekeepers in Asturias face this invasion, being the worst affected agricultural sector. Recently, in February 2018, the Provincial Action Plan was approved and measures are already being taken. This study includes both experimental and bibliographical data on V. velutina, with the intention of producing a preliminary report on the current situation of the invasion in the Principality of Asturias. There is little information regarding the behavior of this species in our ecosystems. The main objective: to broaden our knowledge of the biology and ecology of this hymenopteran in order to be able to act appropriately. There is a close relationship between temperature and the development of the Asian hornet. The worst affected municipalities in Asturias so fare are Llanes, Valdes and Gijon (Figura 15). The high adaptability of queens is very remarkable, and if the optimal climatic conditions are not present, they can even extend the hibernation period (Figura 10). Different factors for involved in the distribution of V. velutina are analyzed in this article, like proximity to freshwater courses and possible attractive plants. Based on the data obtained (Figura 11), in northern Spain queens in the spring seems to have a preference for citrus, garden plants and other fruit trees, and will be found in areas close to rivers, streams and springs. The species also poses a risk to other native insect species, such as the honey bee (Apis mellifera L., 1758) and the European hornet (Vespa crabro L., 1758). Trap data show a higher number of captures of V. velutina (both queens and workers) than V. crabro. Since these are non-selective traps for the genus Vespa, it is suspected that the population of the invasive hornet is outnumbering the population of the native hornet. The population growth of the Asian hornet in the last year has increased considerably, as evidenced by the increase in the number of nests in 2018 compared to 2017. Secondary nests are found mostly in trees ranging from 2 to 20 meters (Figura 16). This is a real threat; quick and effective action is urgent. Trapping work is essential, it is recommended that queen trapping should be done in spring and the trapping of workers should be carried out throughout the summer. The removal of nests is carried out through the entire season, depending on the sightings, the sooner a nest is eliminated the less the hornet´s population will grow. In 2017 a larger number of captured specimens was taken in traps placed near nests that had not been removed (Figura 14), so improvements are necessary both in the position of the traps and in the elimination of nests. More scientific research is needed in order to control the species.

AB  - The Asian hornet, ¡i¿Vespa velutina nigrithorax¡/i¿ (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), is an invasive hornet that was accidentally introduced into Europe in 2004. It mainly preys on other invertebrates and arthropod species, and often targets honey bee (¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿) colonies. The introduction of these hornets may damage indigenous fauna and apiculture. Knowledge of ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ prey preference and the species composition of their diet is relatively limited. In this study, we assessed methodologies for the molecular identification of prey using dissected larvae from destroyed nests. Ten larval samples were taken from five nests in areas where the hornets had not yet established: two from the Channel Islands and three in the mainland UK. DNA was extracted from the gut contents and sequenced and analysed by metabarcoding with Oxford Nanopore Technologies' Flongle and MinION devices. Numerous taxa were detected in each larval sample with the species composition varying by individual and by nest. Between 15 and 26 species were found per nest, with wasps (¡i¿Vespula¡/i¿ spp.), spiders, honey bees and blow flies being the most abundant taxa. These results demonstrate that metabarcoding larval gut contents can be used to study the Asian hornet diet and give a first snapshot of the prey items captured by ¡i¿V. v. nigrithorax¡/i¿ in the UK. This method could be used for future large-scale testing of the gut contents of hornet nests, in order to provide a greater insight into the foraging behaviour of this predator across Europe and elsewhere.

AU  - Nadolski, Jerzy
T2  - Entomologica Fennica
AB  - Various factors affecting the reproductive success of Vespacrabro and Dolichovespula saxonica (Vespinae), including their parasitoids, parasites, pathogens and other micro organisms accompanying their nests in the city of Lodz in Poland were investigated. Sphecophaga vesparum, Aphomia sociella and especially Quedius brevicornis, whose larvae cause destruction of wasp nests, were recorded. Totally 19 species or groups of bacteria, including pathogens like Pseudomon aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and 5 species of fungi were identified. Cities create very good conditions for wasp societies. Unfortunately, their presence can cause specific but important risks to humans, which lead to massive destruction of wasp nests. However, this does not cause considerable decrease in the number of colonies of common wasp species but less abundant species may be endangered in cities by this practice. It is thus recommended to limit the number of all wasp nests destroyed and to discriminate between the species.

AB  - Viruses are known to contribute to bee population decline. Possible spillover is suspected from the co-occurrence of viruses in wild bees and honey bees. In order to study the risk of virus transmission between wild and managed bee species sharing the same floral resource, we tried to maximize the possible cross-infections using Phacelia tanacetifolia, which is highly attractive to honey bees and a broad range of wild bee species. Virus prevalence was compared over two years in Southern France. A total of 1137 wild bees from 29 wild bee species (based on COI barcoding) and 920 honey bees (Apis mellifera) were checked for the seven most common honey bee RNA viruses. Halictid bees were the most abundant. Co-infections were frequent, and Sacbrood virus (SBV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) and Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) were widespread in the hymenopteran pollinator community. Conversely, Deformed wing virus (DWV) was detected at low levels in wild bees, whereas it was highly prevalent in honey bees (78.3

AB  - Honey bee colony health has received considerable attention in recent years, with many studies highlighting multifactorial issues contributing to colony losses. Disease and weather are consistently highlighted as primary drivers of colony loss, yet little is understood about how they interact. Here, we combined disease records from government honey bee health inspections with meteorological data from the CEDA to identify how weather impacts EFB, AFB, CBP, varroosis, chalkbrood and sacbrood. Using R-INLA, we determined how different meteorological variables influenced disease prevalence and disease risk. Temperature caused an increase in the risk of both varroosis and sacbrood, but overall, the weather had a varying effect on the six honey bee diseases. The risk of disease was also spatially varied and was impacted by the meteorological variables. These results are an important step in identifying the impacts of climate change on honey bees and honey bee diseases.

AB  - Gut bacterial communities assist host animals with numerous functions such as food digestion, nutritional provision, or immunity. Some social mammals and insects are unique in that their gut microbial communities are stable among individuals. In this review, we focus on the gut bacterial communities of eusocial insects, including bees, ants, and termites, to provide an overview of their community structures and to gain insights into any general aspects of their structural basis. ¡i¿Pseudomonadota¡/i¿ and ¡i¿Bacillota¡/i¿ are prevalent bacterial phyla commonly detected in those three insect groups, but their compositions are distinct at lower taxonomic levels. Eusocial insects harbor unique gut bacterial communities that are shared within host species, while their stability varies depending on host physiology and ecology. Species with narrow dietary habits, such as eusocial bees, harbor highly stable and intraspecific microbial communities, while generalists, such as most ant species, exhibit relatively diverse community structures. Caste differences could influence the relative abundance of community members without significantly altering the taxonomic composition.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The introduction of the predatory Giant Asian Hornet, ¡jats:italic¿Vespa mandarinia¡/jats:italic¿ Smith, to North America in 2019 has motivated efforts to create early detection systems for this and other non-native social wasp species (Hymenoptera, Vespidae). Various trap and bait combinations have been used for this purpose, most of which require assembly and materials that are costly, reducing their usefulness in large-scale survey systems. This study tests an inexpensive and efficient trapping technique for detecting or surveying vespine wasps. Traps were made from reused plastic bottles containing a brown sugar and water bait. They were deployed at heights ranging from 0–6 m above ground in several configurations. Captures for traps suspended 1 m or greater above ground were, on average, nine times higher than the catch of ground-level traps. A rapid trap deployment method for large geographic areas was created, which captured seven different vespine wasp species along a 395 km east-west road transect from mountains to coastal plain in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The trapping design and survey methodology described below is inexpensive and fast and could be used by land managers or citizen scientists to detect ¡jats:italic¿V. mandarinia¡/jats:italic¿, other exotic vespine, or conducted on a large-scale vespine diversity survey.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - Europe harbours several endemic honeybee (Apis mellifera) subspecies. Yet the distribution of these subspecies is nowadays also much influenced by beekeeping activities. Large scale migratory beekeeping and trade in queens, coupled with the promiscuous mating system of honeybees, have exposed native European honeybees to increasing introgressive hybridization with managed non-native subspecies, which may lead to the loss of valuable combinations of traits shaped by natural selection. Other threats to European honeybees are factors that have caused a progressive decline in A. mellifera throughout the world in recent years, leading to large economic losses and jeopardizing ecosystem functioning. We review the biodiversity of European honeybees and summarize the management and conservation strategies employed by different countries. A comprehensive picture of the beekeeping industry in Europe is also provided. Finally we evaluate the potential threats affecting the biodiversity of European honeybee populations and provide some perspectives for future research.

T2  - Frontiers in physiology
AB  - The honeybee is an important species for the agri-food and pharmaceutical industries through bee products and crop pollination services. However, honeybee health is a major concern, because beekeepers in many countries are experiencing significant colony losses. This phenomenon has been linked to the exposure of bees to multiple stresses in their environment. Indeed, several biotic and abiotic stressors interact with bees in a synergistic or antagonistic way. Synergistic stressors often act through a disruption of their defense systems (immune response or detoxification). Antagonistic interactions are most often caused by interactions between biotic stressors or disruptive activation of bee defenses. Honeybees have developed behavioral defense strategies and produce antimicrobial compounds to prevent exposure to various pathogens and chemicals. Expanding our knowledge about these processes could be used to develop strategies to shield bees from exposure. This review aims to describe current knowledge about the exposure of honeybees to multiple stresses and the defense mechanisms they have developed to protect themselves. The effect of multi-stress exposure is mainly due to a disruption of the immune response, detoxification, or an excessive defense response by the bee itself. In addition, bees have developed defenses against stressors, some behavioral, others involving the production of antimicrobials, or exploiting beneficial external factors.

AB  - The predator Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) represents one of the major threats to honeybee survival. Viral spillover from bee to wasp has been supposed in several studies, and this work aims to identify and study the virome of both insect species living simultaneously in the same foraging area. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on V. velutina and Apis mellifera samples, and replicative form of detected viruses was carried out by strand-specific RT-PCR. Overall, 6 and 9 different viral types were reported in V. velutina and A. mellifera, respectively, and five of these viruses were recorded in both hosts. Varroa destructor virus-1 and Cripavirus NB-1/2011/HUN (now classified as Triato-like virus) were the most represented viruses detected in both hosts, also in replicative form. In this investigation, Triato-like virus, as well as Aphis gossypii virus and Nora virus, was detected for the first time in honeybees. Concerning V. velutina, we report for the first time the recently detected honeybee La Jolla virus. A general high homology rate between genomes of shared viruses between V. velutina and A. mellifera suggests the efficient transmission of the virus from bee to wasp. In conclusion, our findings highlight the presence of several known and newly reported RNA viruses infecting A. mellifera and V. velutina. This confirms the environment role as an important source of infection and indicates the possibility of spillover from prey to predator.

AB  - The first confirmed records of Vespa velutina (color form nigrithorax) in North America are provided along with a timeline of detections in the port city of Savannah GA, USA, an important Atlantic sea and rail port. This color form is the 'invasive' form that has spread throughout much of Europe since its accidental introduction into southern France in 2004. It has also spread into South Korea and Japan. A brief overview of its introduction and establishment in Europe and Asia is provided. Its biology as relevant to its detection in the USA, and its threat to both agriculture and native ecosystems are summarized. We give a brief description and color images of workers to aid in its identification and analyze sequence data for the mitochondrial COI gene to assess if the Savannah population originated either from invasive European, Korean, or Japanese populations, or from part of its native range. An initial genetic analysis supports the conclusion that the invasive population originates from a population in East Asia and not Europe. Further sequencing of the nuclear genome will be required to attribute the invasive population in North America to a specific location in East Asia. The sequenced mitochondrial COI gene matches accessions from individuals located in South Korea, Japan, and Zhejiang Province of China.

AB  - There is an increasing global trend of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) affecting a wide range of species, including honey bees. The global epidemic of the single stranded RNA Deformed wing virus (DWV), driven by the spread of Varroa destructor has been well documented. However, DWV is just one of many insect RNA viruses which infect a wide range of hosts. Here we report the full genome sequence of a novel Iflavirus named Moku virus (MV), discovered in the social wasp Vespula pensylvanica collected in Hawaii. The novel genome is 10,056 nucleotides long and encodes a polyprotein of 3050 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MV is most closely related to Slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV), which is highly virulent in honey bees but rarely detected. Worryingly, MV sequences were also detected in honey bees and Varroa from the same location, suggesting that MV can also infect other hymenopteran and Acari hosts.

The new model of harmonic radar proved to be effective in tracking hornets either in open landscapes, hilly environments and areas characterised by the presence of more obstacles, such as woodlands and urban areas. Hornets were effectively tracked in complex landscapes for a mean tracking length of 96 ± 62 m with maximum values of   300 m. The effectiveness of locating nests was 75

AB  - ¡jats:p¿Honey bees suffer from a cosmic array of biotic and abiotic stress during their life cycle. The insect pests like wax moths and Dermestid beetles contribute immensely to the damage of bee colonies and reduction in honey yield in tropical regions of India. While, the bee colonies in temperate regions of Indian Himalayas, face an entirely different set of hitches that include predation of forager bees by three hornet species (Vespa mandarinia, Vespa velutina nigrithorax and Vespa tropica). The attacks on bee colonies by these hornet species compel the bees to desert the colony and swarm away to a new habitat thus, causing severe economic losses to bee keepers. Considering the severe setbacks enforced by hornets, a low-cost hornet trap was designed. The bait ingredients and their trapping efficiency against targeted hornet species are presented herewith. It was observed that green colored bottles attracted 34 hornets of three species in 10 days, while transparent bottles attracted only seven hornets at bait proportions of 1:2:2 (Apple cedar Vinegar: orange juice: water). Moreover, to reduce the attraction of honey bees into the trap, supplementary ingredients like rotten fruits and market honey were used, which enhanced the trapping efficiency of hornets. The benefit-cost ratio of 12.30:1 was recorded after the installation of the trap, which was significantly superior to traditional method (1.64:1) of manual swatting of hornets in the apiary. The farmers are currently trained to design and use these traps for the management of hornet pests in the Indian Himalayas.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - ¡jats:title¿Abstract¡/jats:title¿ ¡jats:p¿The yellow-legged hornet is an invasive species that has been established in Galicia, northwestern Spain, since 2012. This hornet shows an increased level of invasiveness, which allows it to grow and spread rapidly throughout the territory. Furthermore, the climatic characteristics of the region have contributed to their establishment, with beekeeping being the most affected sector. The study aimed to monitor the predatory behavior of Vespa velutina and its correlation with environmental conditions, as well as the honey bee survival risk of the predation. Temperatures ranging from 17 to 26 °C were the most suitable for observing the higher number of hornets. The hornets were observed in front of the colonies for 16 h a day for 11 months. The presence of five or more hornets posed a risk to the survival of the honey bee colonies. Beekeepers should manage their colonies with artificial feeding and use control methods for survival against V. velutina.¡/jats:p¿

AU  - Jung, Chuleui
AB  - Biological invasion is becoming more important disturbance factor to the structure and function of ecosystem as well as to the bio-industry such as apiculture. Since the invasion of the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax Buysson, 1905 into Busan port, the southeastern part of Korea in 2003, gradual spread of the hornet was observed. The rate of spread was estimated as 12.4 Km/yr, which was 5.6 times slower than that from France, 67.3 Km/yr. The diffusion coefficient (D) is still in increasing phase, implying the greater risk of spread. The Korean population was homologous to Zhejiang population of China implying the possible invasion source. It has a great potential to harm the Korean beekeeping industry and the ecosystem through the competition with the similar guild, the other 10 spcies of Vespa in Korea. Among those, smaller sized hornets such as Vespa analis or V. simillima simillam seemed under serious impact. Community structure of Vespa was different before and after the invasion. After V. velutina invasion, the survey on 2010 from Gyeongnam province showed 67

AB  - Biological invasions are a global challenge that has received insufficient attention. Recently available cost syntheses have provided policy- and decision makers with reliable and up-to-date information on the economic impacts of biological invasions, aiming to motivate effective management. The resultant ¡i¿InvaCost¡/i¿ database is now publicly and freely accessible and enables rapid extraction of monetary cost information. This has facilitated knowledge sharing, developed a more integrated and multidisciplinary network of researchers, and forged multidisciplinary collaborations among diverse organizations and stakeholders. Over 50 scientific publications so far have used the database and have provided detailed assessments of invasion costs across geographic, taxonomic, and spatiotemporal scales. These studies have provided important information that can guide future policy and legislative decisions on the management of biological invasions while simultaneously attracting public and media attention. We provide an overview of the improved availability, reliability, standardization, and defragmentation of monetary costs; discuss how this has enhanced invasion science as a discipline; and outline directions for future development.

T2  - Japan Agricultural Research Quarterly: JARQ
AB  - In this study, the influence of individual cuticular hydrocarbons on nestmate recognition in Japanese hornets was investigated. Cuticular hydrocarbons were extracted from the individuals of several colonies of Japanese hornets, Vespa analis Fablicius (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), and analyzed by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In the case of V. analis, the results of the GC-MS analyses showed 12 major components and 20 minor components. The results showed some intraspecific variation in the quantities of each component of the profiles even within the same colony and same cast. The number of cuticular hydrocarbon compounds of V. analis was relatively high compared with that of V. crabro. Discriminant analysis of the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of the workers and queens showed that the wasps could be grouped by colony and by caste even if the colonies were located at a close distance. The cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of workers and males were different.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The Natural History Museum, London has been creating digital data about collections for many years, with a formal Digital Collections Programme since 2014. Efforts to monitor the outcomes and impact of this work have focused on metrics of digital access, such as download events, and on citations of digital specimens as a measure of use. Digitisation projects and resulting research have also been used as impact case studies, highlighting areas such as human health and conservation. In 2021, the Museum decided to explore the economic impacts of collections data in more depth, and commissioned Frontier Economics to undertake modelling, resulting in this report. While the methods in this report are relevant to collections globally, this modelling focuses on benefits to the UK, and is intended to support the Museum’s own digitisation work, as well as a current scoping study funded by the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities Research Council about the case for digitising all UK natural science collections as a research infrastructure. This study focuses on digitisation in the round, not distinguishing between different collection types or levels of data creation at this stage. Three methods have been used: first, analysing five key thematic areas or sectors where data from natural science collections are likely to lead to benefits; secondly, analysing typical returns on investment in scientific research; and thirdly, examining the efficiency savings that can be reinvested in research if data are available freely and openly. Together, these methods confirm benefits in excess of £2 billion over 30 years, representing a seven to ten times return on investment.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - ¡jats:p¿To provide a complete portrayal of the multiple factors negatively impacting insects in agricultural landscapes it is necessary to assess the concurrent incidence, magnitude, and interactions among multiple stressors over substantial biogeographical scales. Trans-national ecological field investigations with wide-ranging stakeholders typically encounter numerous challenges during the design planning stages, not least that the scientific soundness of a spatially replicated study design must account for the substantial geographic and climatic variation among distant sites. ‘PoshBee’ (Pan-European assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of Stressors on the Health of Bees) is a multi-partner transdisciplinary agroecological project established to investigate the suite of stressors typically encountered by pollinating insects in European agricultural landscapes. To do this, PoshBee established a network of 128 study sites across eight European countries and collected over 50 measurements and samples relating to the nutritional, toxicological, pathogenic, and landscape components of the bees’ environment. This paper describes the development process, rationale, and end-result of each aspect of the of the PoshBee field investigation. We describe the main issues and challenges encountered during the design stages and highlight a number of actions or processes that may benefit other multi-partner research consortia planning similar large-scale studies. It was soon identified that in a multi-component study design process, the development of interaction and communication networks involving all collaborators and stakeholders requires considerable time and resources. It was also necessary at each planning stage to be mindful of the needs and objectives of all stakeholders and partners, and further challenges inevitably arose when practical limitations, such as time restrictions and labour constraints, were superimposed upon prototype study designs. To promote clarity for all stakeholders, for each sub-component of the study, there should be a clear record of the rationale and reasoning that outlines how the final design transpired, what compromises were made, and how the requirements of different stakeholders were accomplished. Ultimately, multi-national agroecological field studies such as PoshBee benefit greatly from the involvement of diverse stakeholders and partners, ranging from field ecologists, project managers, policy legislators, mathematical modelers, and farmer organisations. While the execution of the study highlighted the advantages and benefits of large-scale transdisciplinary projects, the long planning period emphasized the need to formally describe a design framework that could facilitate the design process of future multi-partner collaborations.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - Climate change, loss of plant biodiversity, burdens caused by new pathogens, predators, and toxins due to human disturbance and activity are significant causes of the loss of bee colonies and wild bees. The aim of this review is to highlight some possible strategies that could help develop bee resilience in facing their changing environments. Scientists underline the importance of the links between nutrition, microbiota, and immune and neuroendocrine stress resistance of bees. Nutrition with special care for plant-derived molecules may play a major role in bee colony health. Studies have highlighted the importance of pollen, essential oils, plant resins, and leaves or fungi as sources of fundamental nutrients for the development and longevity of a honeybee colony. The microbiota is also considered as a key factor in bee physiology and a cornerstone between nutrition, metabolism, growth, health, and pathogen resistance. Another stressor is the varroa mite parasite. This parasite is a major concern for beekeepers and needs specific strategies to reduce its severe impact on honeybees. Here we discuss how helping bees to thrive, especially through changing environments, is of great concern for beekeepers and scientists.

AB  - Alien species invasion could lead to the replacement of native species with similar ecological requirements. Vespa velutina is an invasive hornet recently established in Europe, that is raising concern due to the associated economic and ecological impacts toward managed and wild pollinators besides to the potential competition and replacement of native wasp species. This led to the inclusion of V. velutina in the European list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern. Nevertheless, V. velutina impacts on the native wasp community is poorly understood. We analysed the influence of V. velutina abundance on the European hornet Vespa crabro in a four-year invaded area in Italy. Moreover, we assessed the impacts of its presence on V. crabro, Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica, by comparing the invaded area with an uninvaded one. A Bayesian Generalized Linear Model, implemented to control some relevant environmental confounders, indicate that the relationship between Vespa species was positive at low abundances, while for high values of V. velutina the two species did not covary anymore. The distribution of V. crabro, V. vulgaris and V. germanica showed a considerable overlap between the invaded and uninvaded areas. Overall, the results bring to the conclusion that native Vespidae have probably avoided or minimised a competition pressure, and therefore the presence of V. velutina has not led to an evident replacement of V. crabro and Vespula species. This provides reassurance regarding the conservation status of native European Vespidae following V. velutina invasion.

T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - Olfaction is a crucial sensory modality underlying foraging, social and mating behaviors in many insects. Since the olfactory system is at the interface between the animal and its environment, it receives strong evolutionary pressures that promote neuronal adaptations and phenotypic variations across species. Hornets are large eusocial predatory wasps with a highly developed olfactory system, critical for foraging and intra-specific communication. In their natural range, hornet species display contrasting ecologies and olfactory-based behaviors, which might match to adaptive shifts in their olfactory system. The first olfactory processing center of the insect brain, the antennal lobe, is made of morphological and functional units called glomeruli. Using fluorescent staining, confocal microscopy and 3D reconstructions, we compared antennal lobe structure, glomerular numbers and volumes in four hornet species (Vespa crabro, Vespa velutina, Vespa mandarinia and Vespa orientalis) with marked differences in nesting site preferences and predatory behaviors. Despite a conserved organization of their antennal lobe compartments, glomeruli numbers varied strongly between species, including in a subsystem thought to process intraspecific cuticular signals. Moreover, specific adaptations involving enlarged glomeruli appeared in two species, V. crabro and V. mandarinia, but not in the others. We discuss the possible function of these adaptations based on species-specific behavioral differences.

AB  - The invasive Vespa velutina has been widely referred as an effective predator of honeybees. Despite the potential risk to pollination services provision and honey production, there is no accurate quantification and assessment of its real consequences for honeybees. To date, the identification of the honeybee and other insects in the diet of V. velutina has been investigated by direct observation of adult foraging or examination of food pellets. To overcome these limitations, in this study we used a DNA metabarcoding approach to evaluate the usefulness of different types of sample (jaws and stomachs collected from workers and larval faecal pellets taken from the hornet comb) to investigate the predation of V. velutina upon honeybees, and potentially on other insects. Honeybee DNA was identified in all types of samples, but larval faecal pellets retrieved the higher number of reads of honeybee DNA and the largest diversity at all taxonomic levels. Over all samples we could identify 4 orders, 9 families, 6 genera and 1 species of prey. We estimate that collecting 6 workers is sufficient to identify honeybee predation by a colony using worker’s jaws. Stomachs were the least useful sample type to detect honeybee DNA. The presence of honeybee DNA in all analysed colonies irrespective of collection site, and the variety of insect orders detected in the diet support current concerns over the acknowledged negative impact of V. velutina on managed honeybees and its potential threat to pollination services provision.

AB  - Invasive species contribute to deteriorate the health of ecosystems due to their direct effects on native fauna and the local parasite-host dynamics. We studied the potential impact of the invasive hornet Vespa velutina on the European parasite-host system by comparing the patterns of diversity and abundance of pathogens (i.e. Microsporidia: Nosematidae; Euglenozoa: Trypanosomatidae and Apicomplexa: Lipotrophidae) in European V. velutina specimens with those in the native European hornet Vespa crabro, as well as other common Hymenoptera (genera Vespula, Polistes and Bombus). We show that (i) V. velutina harbours most common hymenopteran enteropathogens as well as several new parasitic taxa. (ii) Parasite diversity in V. velutina is most similar to that of V. crabro. (iii) No unambiguous evidence of pathogen release by V. velutina was detected. This evidence together with the extraordinary population densities that V. velutina reaches in Europe (around of 100,000 individuals per km2 per year), mean that this invasive species could severely alter the native pathogen-host dynamics either by actively contributing to the dispersal of the parasites and/or by directly interacting with them, which could have unexpected long-term harmful consequences on the native entomofauna.

AB  - Insecticides are widely used to boost crop yields, but their effects on non-target insects like ¡i¿Vespa magnifica¡/i¿ are still poorly understood. Despite its ecological and economic significance, ¡i¿Vespa magnifica¡/i¿ has been largely neglected in risk assessments. This study employed physiological, biochemical, and transcriptomic analyses to investigate the impact of sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam, avermectin, chlorfenapyr, and β-cypermethrin on ¡i¿Vespa magnifica.¡/i¿ Although larval survival rates remained unchanged, both pupation and fledge rates were significantly reduced. Enzymatic assays indicated an upregulation of superoxide dismutase and catalase activity alongside a suppression of peroxidase under insecticide stress. Transcriptomic analysis revealed increased adenosine triphosphate-related processes and mitochondrial electron transport activity, suggesting elevated energy expenditure to counter insecticide exposure, potentially impairing essential functions like flight, hunting, and immune response. The enrichment of pathways such as glycolysis, hypoxia-inducible factor signaling, and cholinergic synaptic metabolism under insecticide stress highlights the complexity of the molecular response with notable effects on learning, memory, and detoxification processes. These findings underscore the broader ecological risks of insecticide exposure to non-target insects and highlight the need for further research into the long-term effects of newer insecticides along with the development of strategies to safeguard beneficial insect populations.

AB  - The Asian yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, is native to Southeast Asia. However, it has invaded many countries in temperate regions, causing serious threats to honeybees and human health. With a growing demand for estimating the potential distribution of this species, multiple studies have resorted to occurrence-based models. However, they are less informative for predicting local abundance patterns associated with the species' impact. Thus, we aimed to develop an abundance-based distribution model for V. v. nigrithorax in Korea to support the forecast of its impact and associated management strategies. The abundance data of V. v. nigrithorax were collected from 254 sites for 4 years covering the country and used to develop a model with bioclimatic and land composition variables. Along with the abundance model, the classical occurrence model was tested to determine whether it could provide a reasonable prediction on the estimation of local abundance. As a result, the abundance model provided higher discriminative power and accuracy than the occurrence model to evaluate the impacts caused by V. v. nigrithorax. On the other hand, the occurrence model was not able to discriminate abundance in the areas occupied by V. v. nigrithorax, indicating an unclear occurrence-abundance relationship or oversimplification of the estimated niche created by the occurrence model. Based on the final abundance model, risk indices for human health and honeybee losses were suggested. These results could help to provide support for risk management of V. v. nigrithorax in Korea and to give biological information to other countries where this species has already become established or which it is likely to invade in the near future.

AB  - We present a short review of the biology, diagnostic characteristics, and invasiveness of the Oriental hornet, ¡i¿Vespa orientalis¡/i¿. We also performed an analysis of the shape of the forewings (geometric morphometrics) of different geographic groups along their native distribution and their potential geographical distribution using the MaxEnt entropy modeling. Our results show a wide potential expansion range of the species, including an increase in environmentally suitable areas in Europe, Asia, and Africa but more especially the Western Hemisphere, where the species was recently introduced. The geometric morphometric analysis of the forewings shows that there are three different morphogroups: one distributed along the Mediterranean coast of Europe and the Middle East (MEDI), another along the Arabian Peninsula and Western Asia but excluding the Mediterranean coast (MEAS), and one more in northern Africa north of the Sahara and south of the Mediterranean coast (AFRI), all of which show differences in their potential distribution as a result of the pressure from the different environments and which will also determine the capacity of the different morphogroups to successfully invade new habitats.

AB  - The invasive hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax is a rapidly proliferating threat to pollinators in Europe and East Asia. To effectively limit its spread, colonies must be detected and destroyed early in the invasion curve, however the current reliance upon visual alerts by the public yields low accuracy. Advances in deep learning offer a potential solution to this, but the application of such technology remains challenging. Here we present VespAI, an automated system for the rapid detection of V. velutina. We leverage a hardware-assisted AI approach, combining a standardised monitoring station with deep YOLOv5s architecture and a ResNet backbone, trained on a bespoke end-to-end pipeline. This enables the system to detect hornets in real-time-achieving a mean precision-recall score of ≥0.99-and send associated image alerts via a compact remote processor. We demonstrate the successful operation of a prototype system in the field, and confirm its suitability for large-scale deployment in future use cases. As such, VespAI has the potential to transform the way that invasive hornets are managed, providing a robust early warning system to prevent ingressions into new regions.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The first record of the Asian/yellow-legged hornet (¡jats:italic¿Vespa velutina¡/jats:italic¿) in Ireland was reported in April 2021, when a single female individual was discovered in Dublin. ¡jats:italic¿Vespa velutina¡/jats:italic¿ has been present in mainland Europe since 2004 and in the UK since 2016 and poses an enormous threat to European apiculture and bee-mediated pollination services. Three mitochondrial genes were sequenced from the Irish specimen to determine whether the specimen originated from the established European population or signified a new point of entry from its native range in China. Additionally, specimens from Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, and the Channel Islands were sequenced at these three genes to build on previous studies which have asserted, based solely on Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (COI) analysis, that the entire range of ¡jats:italic¿V. velutina¡/jats:italic¿ in Europe represents a single invasion which has proliferated since the first record in France. Further data were retrieved from GenBank for comparison. Results reveal that the mtDNA lineage observed in Dublin is the same as that seen throughout Europe, and therefore the arrival of this species in Ireland likely represents a further spread of the ongoing European invasion.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - How do populations of an introduced insect like the Harlequin become so successful? Are they somehow better adapted to a foreign environment than the native equivalent, or do they claim a niche in the environment that was previously unoccupied? Grain-Fed Scientists are intrigued by just this question -why are some non-native species so successful? The harlequin ladybird provides an excellent example of a successful invader that has spread around the world. Native to Asia it was introduced into the US as a biological control agent of pest insects in 1916 but it was not until the 1980s that it began to spread into the wider countryside. At this time introductions were being made in a number of places throughout Europe. It has a number of so called invasive traits -rapid reproduction, highly opportunistic both in terms of where it will live and what it can eat, high resistance to attack from parasites and predators. We have been working on a citizen science project to track the harlequin ladybird and increase our understanding of the ecology of this new arrival -see - https://www.ceh.ac.uk/news-and-media/blogs/decade-recording-harlequin-ladybirdsuk

AB  - This study investigates the internal architecture of Asian hornet nests (AHNs) using advanced imaging techniques, such as CT scanning and X-ray radiography, to understand their construction and function. The primary objective and significance of this study centre on drawing inspiration from the creative way Asian hornets construct their nests, with a particular focus on the architecture, design, functionality, and building materials of these nests. The architectural principles governing the construction of these nests, such as the arrangement of hexagonal cells, pedicels for load bearing, and adhesive materials, serve as a source of inspiration for innovative and sustainable design practices. The pedicels in Asian hornet nests play a crucial role in transferring load and ensuring stability. Additionally, AHNs' adhesion to tree branches is essential for preventing collapse, and the pedicels provide necessary structural support. The knowledge gained from studying AHNs' internal architecture could be applied directly to the architecture and civil engineering fields to improve structure stability and durability. The microstructure analysis of the paper-like material that hornets produce to build their nests indicates a complex and heterogeneous structure, composed of various plant fragments and fibres. This unique composition creates intricate grooves and pores, which are essential for regulating temperature and humidity levels within the outer envelope of the nest. The study of Asian hornet nests' internal structure demonstrated that nature's engineering principles inspire the design of durable and resilient structures in the construction industry. Civil engineers can incorporate similar principles into their designs to enhance the structural integrity and performance of buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure.

Because the funds available to control biological invasions are limited, there is a need to identify priority species. This paper first review current invasive species prioritization methods and explicitly highlights their pitfalls. We then construct a cost-benefit optimization framework that incorporates species utility, ecological value, distinctiveness, and species interactions. This framework offers the theoretical foundations of a simple and operational method for the management of invasive species under a limited budget constraint. It takes the form of an algorithm for the prioritization of multiple biological invasions.

T2  - Insects
AB  - Most animals must defend themselves in order to survive. Defensive behaviour includes detecting predators or intruders, avoiding them by staying low-key or escaping or deterring them away by means of aggressive behaviour, i.e., attacking them. Responses vary across insect species, ranging from individual responses to coordinated group attacks in group-living species. Among different modalities of sensory perception, insects predominantly use the sense of smell to detect predators, intruders, and other threats. Furthermore, social insects, such as honeybees and ants, communicate about danger by means of alarm pheromones. In this review, we focus on how olfaction is put to use by insects in defensive behaviour. We review the knowledge of how chemical signals such as the alarm pheromone are processed in the insect brain. We further discuss future studies for understanding defensive behaviour and the role of olfaction.

AB  - Genetic diversity is an important biological trait for a successful invasion. During the expansion across a new territory, an invasive species may face unprecedented ecological conditions that will determine its demography and genetic diversity. The first record of the yellow-legged hornet (¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿) in Europe dates back to 2004 in France, from where it has successfully spread through a large territory in the continent, including Italy, Spain and Portugal. Integrative approaches offer a powerful strategy to detect and understand patterns of genetic variation in central and marginal populations. Here, we have analysed the relationship between genetic diversity parameters inferred from 15 ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿ nuclear DNA microsatellite loci, and geographical and environmental drivers, such as the distance to the introduction focus, environmental suitability and distance to native and invasive niche centroids. Our results revealed a central-marginal dynamic, where allelic richness decreased towards the edge of the expansion range. The low environmental suitability of the territories invaded by marginal populations could prevent a diverse population from establishing and reducing the genetic diversity in populations at the expansion edge. Moreover, Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis showed both geographical and environmental distances were influencing population genetic differentiation. This study highlights the importance of combining genetic analysis with geographical and environmental drivers to understand genetic trends of invasive species to new environment.

AB  - The process of invasion and the desire to predict the invasiveness (and associated impacts) of new arrivals has been a focus of attention for ecologists over centuries. The volunteer recording community has made unique and inspiring contributions to our understanding of invasion biology within Britain. Indeed information on non-native species (NNS) compiled within the GB Non-Native Species Information Portal (GB-NNSIP) would not have been possible without the involvement of volunteer experts from across Britain. Here we review examples of ways in which biological records have informed invasion biology. We specifically examine NNS information available within the GB-NNSIP to describe patterns in the arrival and establishment of NNS providing an overview of habitat associations of NNS in terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments. Monitoring and surveillance of the subset of NNS that are considered to be adversely affecting biodiversity, society or the economy, termed invasive non-native species (INNS), is critical for early warning and rapid response. Volunteers are major contributors to monitoring and surveillance of INNS and not only provide records from across Britain but also underpin the system of verification necessary to confirm the identification of sightings. Here we describe the so-called ‘alert system’ which links volunteer experts with the wider recording community to provide early warning of INNS occurrence. We highlight the need to increase understanding of community and ecosystem-level effects of invasions and particularly understanding of ecological resilience. Detailed field observations, through biological recording, will provide the spatial, temporal and taxonomic breadth required for such research. The role of the volunteer recording community in contributing to the understanding of invasion biology has been invaluable and it is clear that their expertise and commitment will continue to be so. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015,

TI  - Hornet biological radar for detection, tracking, direction finding, and long distance communication: Is this possible?
AU  - Gavan, J.

T2  - URSI Radio Science Bulletin
AB  - The late, great entomologist, Prof. Jacob S. Ishay, from the faculty of medicine in Tel-Aviv University, dedicated his life to hornet research. He found that the hornet's body produces a considerable amount of electrical energy by means of photovoltaic and piezoelectric effects. Using an electronic microscope, Prof. Ishay showed to the authors the existence of two-dimensional arrays of very short spikes on the body skin of hornets, not unlike antenna arrays for radar and wireless communication systems. Later, Prof. Ishay and his team also found that the hornet's two antennas produce electricity and include spikes. These three radiation sources enable direction finding - even at great distances - from cooperative targets by wireless communication, allowing a new hypothesis of triangulation and an inverse GPS property for hornets. In this paper, a hypothetical biological radar for hornets is presented. In particular, we present a hypothesis regarding short spikes that may act as three phased arrays with extremely short monopole antenna elements. Due to their tiny physical dimensions, the frequency range of the antennas was estimated to be beyond 250 GHz, in the THz band. A comparison with other biological radar and direction-finding wireless communication systems is also provided.

AB  - The Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) has rapidly become a source of stress for the beekeeping sector. Several methods have been developed to control its impact and spread, though some of these impose a high risk for native insects. Among these methods are electric harps, which are physical barriers that electrocute hornets pass through two wires powered by a current generator. Here we evaluated the selectiveness and risk of damage for local entomofauna of the electric harps in a study carried out over three years and four locations in Girona province (NE Catalonia, Spain).

AB  - ¡jats:p¿Trapping the Asian hornet remains a viable alternative to monitor its presence, dispersion, and ecological niche. With the objective of evaluating the effectiveness of baits and traps, an Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) capture trial was conducted using combinations of artisanal and commercial baits and traps. The second objective was to explore the relationship between the species’ dispersal patterns and the influence of human, geography, climate, and vegetation factors, to identify the preferred conditions for its colonization. We identified beekeepers in the Alto Minho region of Northern Portugal, where the different combinations of baits and traps were placed. The traps were monitored from February to September 2023, and the captures were counted. The temporal variation of the captures showed a first peak at the beginning of April, corresponding to primary workers. In September, when the trial was halted, the second peak, corresponding to secondary workers, had not yet been reached. The peaks of captures were used to fit models to allow the characterisation of their ecological niche. Statistical analysis of the captures revealed no significant differences. It was concluded that there is no advantage in using the commercial devices and baits tested. The ecological niche where the higher number of captures is observed is characterised by an abundance of vegetation, humidity, and higher temperatures. Elevation and slope also favour the presence of the Asian hornet.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - Shortly after the introduction of systemic insecticides, new problems were observed by beekeepers on honeybee colonies. The studies carried out under laboratory conditions have shown sublethal effects on honeybee behavior. However, it was not possible to reproduce under natural conditions the effects described by beekeepers on bee colonies. In addition, studies have revealed that many other factors could also be responsible for the dysfunction of honeybee colonies. Scientists agree that problems observed on the hives are the result of multifactorial effects. Measures concerning apicultural and agricultural practices are therefore necessary to improve honeybee colonies' health and to preserve the diversity of pollinators in France.

AB  - After the nationwide, massive winter losses of honey bees in Korea during the winter of 2021, samplings were conducted from live honey bees in colonies and dead honey bees nearby colonies in the same bee-farms in six regions in Korea. Each sample was subjected to virome analysis using high-throughput sequencing technology. The number of viral reads was the lowest in the live honey bee group sample with 370,503 reads and the highest in the dead honey bee group sample with 42,659,622 reads. Viral contigs were matched with the viral genomes of the black queen cell virus, deformed wing virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus, and sacbrood virus, all of which have been previously reported in Korea. However, Apis rhabdovirus 5, bee macula-like virus, Varroa orthomyxovirus-1, Hubei partiti-like virus 34, Lake Sinai virus 2, 3, and 4, and the Ditton virus, were also discovered in this study, which are the first records in Korea. Plant viral sequences resembling those of Arabidopsis latent virus 1, and a novel viral sequence was also discovered. In the present study 55 complete viral genome sequences were identified. This study is the first virome analysis of domestic honey bees and provides the latest information on the diversity of honey bee viruses in Korea.

AB  - Entomopathogenic fungi are commonly used as biological control agents. Recently, a strain of Metarhizium robertsii (Metchnikoff) Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) collected in France was identified as a good candidate for controlling invasive populations of the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax (Buysson, 1905) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) in Europe. Since M. robertsii is a generalist parasite, its usage as bioagent could be damaging for non-targeted species. Here we compared the lethal effects of three concentrations of this M. robertsii strain on V. v. nigrithorax and two non-target species commonly found in Europe, the common wasp Vespula vulgaris (Linnaeus, 1758) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) and the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus, 1758) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Exposure to M. robertsii spores altered the survival of all three species but at different degrees. Hornets had a consistently lower survival, even under low spore concentrations, when compared to wasps and bumblebees. The low susceptibility of the beneficial hymenopterans is encouraging in the perspectives of using M. robertsii as a biocontrol agent against invasive hornets.

T2  - Insects
AB  - ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ (Lepeletier, 1836) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) is a eusocial insect that lives in colonies of hundreds to thousands of individuals, which are divided into castes according to their task: queens, workers, and males. The proper functioning of the colony requires communication between the individuals that make up the colony. Chemical signals (pheromones) are the most common means of communication used by these insects to alarm and differentiate between individuals belonging or not to the colony. In this work, profiles of volatile organic compounds were obtained from the hornets and the external cover of four secondary nests located in the Basque Country. The obtained profiles were treated using chemometric tools. The grouping of hornets and nests according to the different colonies and geographical location was observed. In total, 37 compounds were found in common in hornets and nests. Most of them have been reported in the literature as belonging to different insects and plant species. This would corroborate the transfer of chemical compounds between the nest and the hornets' nest and vice versa. This information could be applied to the development of more efficient control methods for this invasive species, such as attractive traps or baits containing the relevant compounds.

AB  - The yellow-legged Asian hornet Vespa velutina was accidentally introduced into France before 2004.

Molecular analyses and invasion scenarios carried out within the framework of a community program to support European beekeeping by a team of researchers from the laboratory Évolution, Génomes, Comportement, Écologie of Gif-sur-Yvette, the Institut de systématique, évolution, biodiversité and the Institut Sophia Agrobiotech have determined the origin of the invasive lineages of the hornet and identified biological factors that may explain its successful acclimatization in France. The prediction of the potential acclimation areas of V. v. nigrithorax in Europe and worldwide was an essential preliminary step to implement specific surveillance and control measures. This modeling work was carried out thanks to the active collaboration of researchers from three National Museum of Natural History teams: ISYEB, CESCO and UMS PatriNat.

AU  - Martin, SJ
AB  - This book by Professor Stephen Martin aims to cover all the key aspects of the hornets’ biology including the impact they have on both people and honey bees. The information presented is gained from various sources during the many years Professor Martin studied hornets in Asia (mainly Japan), and more recently via the ever-expanding scientific literature on the spread and impact of the Asian hornet both in France and South Korea. The accidental introduction of the Asian hornet or more accurately the yellow-legged hornet into France and South Korea over ten years ago and its subsequent spread to neighbouring countries has been worrying both governments and beekeepers alike. Many people are now seeking more information on this new threat to our beloved honey bees. Hornet biology is very different to that of honey bees and this can lead to misunderstandings and false assumptions. So, this book is aimed at anyone wanting to learn more about hornets, why the Asian hornet possesses such a threat, and what you can do about it. While the natural history of hornets makes their eradication impossible, it is important that all interested parties are well informed about their biology and potential impact. The Asian hornet will continue to expand its range into new countries irrespective of the measures taken, so education is the best way to lessen their impact.

AB  - Apiaries in Galicia, northwestern Spain, are currently facing the invasive alien species Vespa velutina, which is well established in the region. The pressure on honey bee colonies is high, resulting in both economic and ecological losses. Honey bee colonies also face the challenge of viruses, which are becoming increasingly diverse. In recent years, honey bee viruses have been spreading across taxonomic groups beyond Apoidea, infecting the Vespoidea superfamily. This cross-species spillover has raised concerns in the scientific community due to the potential risk of viruses spreading in ecosystems. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge on this topic, and further research is needed to address this issue. This study employed qPCR and sequencing to investigate the prevalence, loads, and presence of replicative forms of important honey bee viruses in V. velutina individuals collected from 11 apiaries in Galicia. All V. velutina individuals tested positive for DWV, BQCV, AKI complex (ABPV, KBV, and IAPV), or LSV but not for CBPV. DWV showed the highest prevalence (97.0

However, today it is well established that they possess unique abilities to learn and use their experience in future decisions. Like many higher animals insects are able to acquire and retain information on when and where to forage, which mate to choose, where to lay their eggs and how to navigate in complex habitats. Learning can be surprisingly fast with only one single encounter with a suitable food source or oviposition site shaping an insect's preference for up to a lifetime. In this review, we discuss the scope and limits of insect learning, focusing in specific on olfactory learning, and we raise the question whether currently used learning paradigms in artificial lab set-ups are able to answer all ecologically relevant questions.¡/jats:p¿

T2  - Frontiers in insect science
AB  - Hornets are large, predatory wasps that have the potential to alter biotic communities and harm honey bee colonies once established in non-native locations. Mated, diapausing females (gynes) can easily be transported to new habitats, where their behavioral flexibility allows them to found colonies using local food and nest materials. Of the 22 species in the genus ¡i¿Vespa¡/i¿, five species are now naturalized far from their endemic populations and another four have been detected either in nature or during inspections at borders of other countries. By far the most likely pathway of long-distance dispersal is the transport of gynes in transoceanic shipments of goods. Thereafter, natural dispersal of gynes in spring and accidental local transport by humans cause shorter-range expansions and contribute to the invasion process. Propagule pressure of hornets is unquantified, although it is likely low but unrelenting. The success of introduced populations is limited by low propagule size and the consequences of genetic founder effects, including the extinction vortex linked to single-locus, complementary sex determination of most hymenopterans. Invasion success is enhanced by climatic similarity between source locality and introduction site, as well as genetic diversity conferred by polyandry in some species. These and other factors that may have influenced the successful establishment of invasive populations of ¡i¿V. velutina¡/i¿, ¡i¿V. tropica¡/i¿, ¡i¿V. bicolor¡/i¿, ¡i¿V. orientalis¡/i¿, and ¡i¿V. crabro¡/i¿ are discussed. The highly publicized detections of ¡i¿V. mandarinia¡/i¿ in North America and research into its status provide a real-time example of an unfolding hornet invasion.

AB  - Pesticides used for plant protection can indirectly affect target and non-target organisms and are identified as a major cause of insect decline. Depending on species interactions, pesticides can be transferred into the environment from plants to preys and predators. While the transfer of pesticides is often studied through vertebrate and aquatic exposure, arthropod predators of insects may represent valuable bioindicators of environmental exposure to pesticides. A modified QuEChERS extraction coupled with HPLC-MS/MS analysis was used to address the question of the exposure to pesticides of the invasive hornet Vespa velutina, a specialist predator of honey bees. This analytical method allows the accurate quantification of nanogram/gram levels of 42 contaminants in a sample weight that can be obtained from single individuals. Pesticide residues were analyzed in female workers from 24 different hornet nests and 13 different pesticides and 1 synergist, piperonyl butoxide, were identified and quantified. In 75

AB  - There is broad consensus on the socioeconomic importance of beekeeping and the essential services it provides through pollination. However, beekeeping is being impacted by global environmental changes, and more specific insights are needed. Beekeeping is not a homogeneous activity; it is practiced in various ways and contexts. This study examines how these changes affect beekeeping operations of different sizes in Mediterranean Spain and whether size influences adaptation. Structured interviews were conducted to assess the sector's vulnerability, with climate change identified as a key contributing factor. The findings reveal that the vulnerability of beekeeping is shaped not only by multiple transformations but also by the diverse adaptive capacities of beekeepers. Additionally, the size of beekeeping operations significantly influences this capacity, a factor that should be integrated into policymaking given the sector's highly polarized nature.

These characteristics are closely linked to its acute olfactory sensitivity, venom-aided predation, and flight capacity. However, the lack of high-quality genomic resources limits understanding of its adaptive evolution and invasive potential. In this study, DNBSEQ, Oxford Nanopore sequencing, and Hi-C sequencing were employed to sequence and assemble the genome of V. mandarinia. The assembled genome consisted of 25 chromosomes.

AB  - The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax , is an invasive species that is causing numerous ecological and economic problems, particularly for beekeepers, whose apiaries are seriously affected by hornet predation. The effects may be intensified if hornet workers from different colonies are preying upon bees from the same apiary. Therefore, to determine whether such could occur, we sampled hornets found within identifiable colonies versus in front of beehives. We employed two complementary methodological approaches: the analysis of chemical markers (i.e., cuticular hydrocarbons) and genetic markers (i.e., microsatellites). Although there was chemical variation among hornets, we determined that at least two chemically homogeneous hornet groups could be found within each apiary studied (using K-means clustering). Furthermore, when hornet chemical dissimilarity was quantified at three different levels (within apiaries, within hornet colonies, and between hornet colonies), we discovered that the within-apiary dissimilarity was intermediate relative to within-colony and between-colony dissimilarity, suggesting that the hornets within a given apiary represented a mixture of individuals from more than one colony. Based on the genetic markers, hornet genetic diversity was low at the population level, as expected for this introduced species. That said, the genetic results mirrored the chemical results: genetic dissimilarity was larger between colonies and smaller within colonies. However, the hornets within a given apiary displayed an intermediate dissimilarity value. Consequently, both our chemical and genetic findings suggested that apiaries could be attacked by hornets from more than one colony.

AB  - Hornet is a general term for insects of the genus ¡i¿Vespa¡/i¿ (Hymenoptera: Vespidae). Hornets are predatory insects distributed worldwide. They often appear at apiaries in groups to prey on honey bees, and cause incalculable losses in the honey bee industry. In the face of hornet intrusion, tracking a homing hornet to find its nest is the most efficient way to discover and eliminate the hornets around an apiary. Here, five hornet-tracking methods (hornet tag tracking, triangulation, thermal imaging technology, harmonic radar, and radio telemetry) are reviewed. The advantages, disadvantages and feasibility of each method are discussed to improve the strategies for tracking hornets. Therefore, this review provides ideas for the development of hornet-tracking technology and for improving honey bee protection.

AB  - Asian hornets (Vespa velutina) are voracious predators of bees, and are the latest emerging threat to managed and wild pollinator populations in Europe. To prevent establishment or reduce the rate of spread of V. velutina, early detection and destruction of nests is considered the only option. Detection is difficult as their nests are well hidden and flying hornets are difficult to follow over long distances. We address this challenge by tracking individual V. velutina workers flying back to their nests using radio telemetry for the first time, finding five previously undiscovered nests, up to 1.33 km from hornet release points. Hornets can fly with 0.28 g tags if the tag:hornet ratio is less than 0.8. This method offers a step-change in options to tackle the spread of this invader, providing an efficient means of finding V. velutina nests in complex environments to manage this emerging threat to pollinators.

T2  - Journal of Applied Entomology
AB  - Since its accidental introduction in 2004, the Asian yellow‐legged hornet (Vespa velutina) has quickly spread in France. V. velutina specializes in the emblematic honeybee, Apis mellifera which are unable to protect their colonies efficiently against this fierce new predator. Here, we investigated whether two defence devices, a ploy and a muzzle, can protect bee colonies. Our results showed that neither device was able to reduce the number of hornets present in front of the hive or their predation efficiency (i.e. the number of captured bees). However, we found more flying bees and a smaller bee carpet in the presence of a muzzle, evidence that this very cheap method of protection can reduce the hornets’ impact on the activity of the bee colony and thus probably enabling its survival. We also showed that the number of agonistic interactions among V. velutina individuals increased with the number of hornets but without influencing the predation rate in our experimental conditions. The threat to honey bees is now well described, but the Asian yellow‐legged hornet very likely has an impact on another insect species that has been the subject of far fewer studies: The native European hornet (Vespa cabro). Monitoring of several apiaries suggests that high densities of both V. velutina and V. crabro are exclusive and that the two species are engaged in an exploitative competition interaction. We are thus already in a position to underline the need for combined protection, as well as for further studies to better understand the ecology of V. velutina, to reduce the damage they cause.

AB  - The invasive alien species (IAS) Vespa bicolor is the first reported hornet that has established in Taiwan and is concerning as they prey on honeybee Apis mellifera, which leads to colony losses and public concerns. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the current status of V. bicolor abundance, dispersal, and impact and to trace the origins of Taiwan's V. bicolor population. Our studies took place in five areas in northern to central Taiwan. We used mtDNA in the phylogenetic analyses. Field survey and ecological niche modeling (ENM) were used to understand the origins and current range of the invasive species. Two main subgroups of V. bicolor in the phylogenetic tree were found, and a clade with short branch lengths in Southeastern China and Taiwan formed a subgroup, which shows that the Taiwan population may have invaded from a single event. Evidence shows that V. bicolor is not a severe pest to honeybees in the study area; however, using ENM, we predict the rapid dispersion of this species to the cooler and hilly mountain areas of Taiwan. The management of V. bicolor should also involve considering it a local pest to reduce loss by beekeepers and public fear in Taiwan. Our findings highlight how the government, beekeepers, and researchers alike should be aware of the implications of V. bicolor's rapid range expansion in Taiwan, or in other countries.

AB  - Implementing management practices for the control of invasive species can be a complex task with multiple dimensions, where the identification of stakeholders and drivers of those practices is of paramount importance. The invasive hornet Vespa velutina has spread across Europe and Asia from its native range in SE Asia in recent years. A common control method is the removal and destruction of its nests on citizens' request to call centers. In this paper we have explored the knowledge and main factors that influence the perceptions of the citizens on the species in an invaded municipality in NW Spain, as well as the management practices of the municipal emergency unit responsible for nest removal activities. Our analysis brings out multiple drivers of management practices that derive both from the citizens' and practitioners' knowledge, and highlights several points of conflict between both stakeholder groups connected to (1) the degree of service provided to the local population, (2) the risk of allergic reactions as a motive to urge removals, or (3) the quality of information provided by mass media. Our results support the crucial importance of environmental education programs that seek to increase the knowledge of the general public about the threats of invasive species. Such programs might be incorporated to implement and optimize management plans of V. velutina by enhancing communication between experts and local population.

AB  - The recent decades witnessed the collapse of honey bee colonies at a global level. The major drivers of this collapse include both individual and synergic pathogen actions, threatening the colonies' survival. The need to define the epidemiological pattern of the pathogens that are involved has led to the establishment of monitoring programs in many countries, Italy included. In this framework, the health status of managed honey bees in the Emilia-Romagna region (northern Italy) was assessed, throughout the year 2021, on workers from 31 apiaries to investigate the presence of major known and emerging honey bee pathogens. The prevalence and abundance of DWV, KBV, ABPV, CBPV, ¡i¿Nosema ceranae¡/i¿, and trypanosomatids (¡i¿Lotmaria passim, Crithidia mellificae, Crithidia bombi¡/i¿) were assessed by molecular methods. The most prevalent pathogen was DWV, followed by CBPV and ¡i¿N. ceranae.¡/i¿ Trypanosomatids were not found in any of the samples. Pathogens had different peaks in abundance over the months, showing seasonal trends that were related to the dynamics of both bee colonies and ¡i¿Varroa destructor¡/i¿ infestation. For some of the pathogens, a weak but significant correlation was observed between abundance and geographical longitude. The information obtained in this study increases our understanding of the epidemiological situation of bee colonies in Emilia-Romagna and helps us to implement better disease prevention and improved territorial management of honey bee health.

AB  - ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ accidentally arrived in Europe (France) in 2004, and rapidly expanded throughout the entire country. Its presence in mainland Portugal was first noticed in 2011. Being an invasive species with no natural predators in the region to control it, it has caused enormous environmental and economic damage, particularly on ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿ (honeybee) colonies. Although there is already some research on this species' biology, little is known about its adaption to European ecological conditions, specifically in terms of nest building. This type of hornet builds a primary nest in the spring to start a colony. During the summer, they build a secondary nest to develop the main colony. These secondary nests are ovoid-shaped and range in size from 18.7 cm to 45.0 cm in diameter and from 19.2 cm to 65.0 cm in length, attaining their highest development in late summer. The external appearance of these nests is characterized by alternating stripes that are beige and brown in color. The main objective of this study is to identify the composition and the origin of the materials that are used by ¡i¿Vespa velutina nigrithorax¡/i¿ to build the outer envelope of these secondary nests. This information could be very interesting and will not only increase our knowledge on the biology of the species in regions far from its original area, but will also be relevant for the future implementation of new policies to control this invasive species by means biological control. Several samples were taken from each nest and were observed under different optical magnifying devices. In the second stage, their chemical composition was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS). It was noticed that almost all of the materials used in the nests' construction were lignocellulose from woody materials from both softwood (gymnosperm) and hardwood (angiosperm) forest species as well from leaves and small particles of agricultural origin (grasses). The beige strips were formed almost exclusively from woody softwood cells, while the brown strips were composed of hardwood cells, leaf tissues, and grasses. Chemically, it was noticed that this material mainly consisted of cellulose, with more than 99

T2  - The Importance of Biological Interactions in the Study of Biodiversity
AB  - Hundreds of alien arthropods, native to different continents or introduced from other parts of Europe, have been recorded in Italy in the last few decades (Jucker et al., 2009; Pellizzari & Dalla Monta, 1997; Pellizzari et al., 2005). Italy is at high risk of introduction of exotic insects, particularly because of the country’s climatic conditions, which support many subtropical species, and its position in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, which makes Italy a commercial and tourist crossroad. Invasion is a normal ecological process, but it can be incentivized by human activities with processes far more rapid than those that occur in purely native systems. Biological invasion by exotic species is considered one of the main threats to the loss of biodiversity; it can cause enormous damage in terms of socio-economic costs, harm human health, and result in ecological losses (Kenis et al., 2009). The rise in economic costs can be attributed to yield losses, in agriculture and horticulture, or to increases in the production costs for pest management. The severe economic impact of these species is evident: the crudest estimate of the total known monetary impact of alien species in Europe is close to 10 billion euros annually (COM, 2008). Moreover, the damage to human health leads to major costs connected to control programs and public health measures. Damage is due to irritation and disease transmission by hematophagous species, or to allergies, and other maladies by other groups of insects. The introduction of a species affects the ecosystem of the new habitat in different ways: the invasive species can be a herbivore, predator, or parasitoid, and can compete with indigenous species via different interactions (competition, disease transmission, hybridization). The major pathways of arthropod migration are indeed accidental, represented by different means of transports, the trade in ornamental plants and other goods, and tourism; natural climatic events can also be responsible for the movement of arthropods. We likewise have to consider that sometimes the introduction of the invasive species is voluntary, and even if the insect itself is helpful, can become a serious threat to a country’s biodiversity. The deliberate introduction into the new environment can be for productive purposes or as a control agent (the classical biological control, based on importation of natural enemies from the country of origin of the exotic pest). Rodolia cardinalis (Mulsant), imported in California in the late 19th century to control cottony cushion scale, has ever since been a textbook example illustrating the accomplishments of biological control.

AB  - The invasive hornet Vespa velutina Lepeletier, which first invaded South Korea in 2003, has spread throughout the country, significantly affecting apiaries, ecosystems, and human health. Xenos spp. (Xenidae, Strepsiptera) are primarily parasitic to social wasps, with V. analis being the only known host in Korea. Until recently, no parasites or parasitoids on V. velutina had been discovered. In 2020, strepsipteran parasites were discovered on 11 hornet workers in Andong City, South Korea. These parasites, comprising four larvae and seven pupae, were all male, except for one individual of an undetermined sex. Molecular analysis and morphological examination identified the parasites as Xenos moutoni (du Buysson, 1903) and X. oxyodontes Nakase & Kato, 2013. This marks the first recorded instance of strepsipteran parasites on V. velutina in regions invaded by this hornet. Although the exact infection rate of these parasites could not be determined, it appears that native strepsipteran parasites have adapted to a non-native Vespa species. Stylopization, the condition caused by these parasites, is known to negatively affect hornet colonies: infected workers do not contribute to nest activities, hindering nest development, and infected reproductive individuals (males and new queens) do not mate, which impedes the establishment of new colonies. However, due to the hornet's high reproductive rate and compensatory mechanisms, the overall control effect of the parasites is likely to be minor.

AB  - Nutritional exchanges play a fundamental role in the evolution of animal societies. In higher animal societies, while adult individuals can be both food donors and receivers, the offspring usually only receive food from the adults. Hornets and wasps are fierce insect hunters that feed their larvae with prey. However, although the adults also consume floral nectar, the role of nectar in vespid nutrition has remained largely unknown. We provided experimental colonies of the Oriental hornet with artificial nectar enriched with a ¡sup¿13¡/sup¿C-labeled amino acid, and found that a continuous cycle of nutrition took place, in which nectar nutrients were used and exchanged back and forth between adults and larvae. We posit that this continuous cycle of nutrients constitutes a mechanism contributing to social cohesion. In an additional experiment, we found that nectar consumption was essential for adult and larval survival, suggesting the importance of wasps and hornets as pollinators in natural ecosystems.

T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Eusociality, a form of animal social organization involving sterile and reproductive castes, is a rare but, arguably, a highly ecologically successful form of life. There are striking examples of eusocial species with populations that are ecologically dominant in their native ranges, as well as remarkably successful globally as invasive species; prominent examples include fire ants and yellowjacket wasps. At the same time, there have been startling population declines in other social insects, notably bumble bees. Here, we explore the possible role of phenotypic plasticity in invasion biology and declines of social insect species. This topic is of particular interest, because social insects exhibit extreme behavioral, developmental, physiological, and morphological plasticity. It has been suggested that this plasticity may contribute to ecological dominance in some species, but could be a liability or cost to others. In this review, we explore the relationship between phenotypic plasticity, invasion biology, and vulnerability to global change in social insects. By considering plasticity at three levels– molecular, individual, and colony—we suggest ways in which considerations of phenotypic plasticity may help in managing social insect populations.

We highlight here the too often ignored potential of mechanistic models in identifying critical stress combinations. Advanced bee models are now available as open access tools and offer an unprecedented opportunity for bee biologists to explore bee resilience tipping points in a variety of environmental contexts. We provide general guidelines on how to run bee models to help detect a priori critical stress combinations to be targeted in the field. This so-called funnel analysis should be performed in tight conjunction with the recent development of large-scale field monitoring programs for bee health surveillance.

These changes are so fundamental that we are presently witnessing the birth of the new epoch ? the Anthropocene. This era is driven by a ?Great Acceleration? i.e. the human population growing rapidly, which results in a drastic increase in the demand for energy, land and water. The expanding human population penetrates areas previously inhabited by other organisms and displaces them from their natural habitats. This leads to the sixth mass extinction and the Insectageddon. The rate at which the biosphere is currently changing is very rapid and undoubtedly, more action needs to be taken to protect the Earth and its living organisms.

AB  - ¡jats:title¿Abstract¡/jats:title¿¡jats:p¿Insects are the most diverse group on earth, providing a vast array of essential functions for people and nature. Yet, our appreciation of their contributions is biased towards a few economically important taxa, especially pollinating insects like honeybees. Other taxa are less well appreciated despite the important roles they play, and these taxa are rarely (if ever) the focus of conservation initiatives. Here, we explore the role that scientists play through their interactions with the media in shaping our attitudes towards one of the least appreciated insects—the aculeate (stinging) wasps. Vespine wasps are an excellent taxonomic group for such a study as they are important predators in native ecosystems (e.g., the Northern Hemisphere—in Europe and North America) but ecologically devastating as invasive species in many regions of the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., New Zealand, Australia, South America). Despite this, global media coverage of wasps invariably focuses on and emotively exaggerates the negative defensive stinging behaviour of wasps, and almost entirely overlooks their beneficial positive roles (as pest controllers and pollinators). Wasp and bee scientists from around the world were surveyed about their interactions with the media and how they considered these interactions to influence public perceptions and insect conservation. Our surveys capture the negative-wasp and positive-bee biases experienced by scientists through their interactions with the media. We consider the implications of such biases on wasp populations, their conservation and management, and make recommendations for a more balanced portrayal of this important and diverse group of insects.¡/jats:p¿

AU  - Odemer, Richard
AB  - ¡p¿For nearly 100 years, electronic bee counters have been developed using various technologies to track the foraging activity of mostly honey bee colonies. These counters should enable remote monitoring of the hives without disturbing natural flight behavior while generating precise scientific data. Today, however, there are not many counters on the market, that are able to fulfill this task. One main challenge is the lack of standardized methods to validate a counter’s precision, but validation is crucial to categorize and judge the data produced by the counter, especially for scientific purposes. Another challenge is the interpretation of flight data to measure the effects of environmental or anthropogenic sources. Nevertheless, recent developments in the field are promising. This review describes the historic development of automated bee flight measurement and critically compares validation methods to encourage their improvement. Lastly, to increase the comparability of future analyses with bee counters, current advances in data interpretation are also presented.¡/p¿

AB  - Insect venom is one of the most common triggers of anaphylaxis in the elderly population. Venom immunotherapy (VIT) remains the only treatment for Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA). However, little is known about the differences in indication for VIT in the group of patients aged 60 years and older. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical and diagnostic differences of HVA in elderly patients. The study compared data from patients aged ≥ 60 (N = 132) to data from patients aged from 11 to 60 years (N = 750) in terms of HVA severity, comorbidities, and immunological parameters, namely, intradermal testing (IDT), specific IgE (sIgE) levels against extracts and major allergenic molecules, and serum tryptase level (sBT). The severity of systemic HVA (I-IV Müller scale) did not differ between adults and seniors. However, the severity of cardiovascular reactions (IV) increased with age, while the frequency of respiratory reactions (III) decreased. No differences were found in the immunological parameters of sensitization IDT, venom-specific IgE concentrations, or sIgE against Api m 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10 between patients below and above 60 or 65 years of age. Differences were noted for sIgE against Ves v1 and Ves v5; they were higher and lower, respectively, in seniors. In the seniors group, sBT levels were higher. Elevated tryptase levels, along with the aging process, can represent a risk factor within this age category. Nevertheless, advanced age does not influence the immunological parameters of immediate HVA reactions, nor does it impact the diagnosis of HVA.

AB  - The study of microbiota of social insects under different ecological conditions can provide important insights into the role of microbes in their biology and behavior. Polistes is one of the most widely distributed and extensively studied genera of social wasps, yet a comprehensive study on the microbiota of any species of Polistes or any primitively eusocial wasp is missing. Polistes wattii is an Asian wasp, which hibernates in winter and exhibits a biannual nest founding strategy. It is often parasitized by the strepsipteran endoparasite/parasitoid Xenos gadagkari, which changes the morpho-physiology and behavior of their hosts. In this study, we employ 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, using the Oxford Nanopore platform, to study the microbial community of P. wattii and investigate the effects of seasonality, sex, and Xenos parasitism. We show that the microbiota differs in females from solitary foundress spring nests and multiple foundress summer nests. The microbiota also differs in males and females. Finally, we show that X. gadagkari parasitism replaces and homogenizes the microbiota of P. wattii. Unlike the unparasitized wasps, the microbiota of X. gadagkari parasitoids and parasitized wasps are dominated by Wolbachia and Providencia. Although the normal microbiota of P. wattii resembles that of highly eusocial vespid wasps, we show that the microbiota of parasitized P. wattii becomes more like the microbiota of strepsipterans. Therefore, it appears that X. gadagkari and other such strepsipteran parasitoids may have a bigger impact on the biology of their hosts than previously thought.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿Flower-visiting bees and wasps (Hymenoptera: Apoidea, Pompiloidea, Scolioidea, Tiphioidea, and Vespoidea) provide essential services in agricultural and urban systems, and ecological functions in natural ecosystems. Understanding the population trends, resource requirements and preferences, ecological challenges, and how to manage these species better requires increased surveys and standardized monitoring efforts for both groups. A monitoring program performed at various scales that provides ecological data is a prerequisite to managing either bees or wasps for conservation or crop pollination purposes. Methods to survey and monitor bees and wasps can be accomplished by a variety of means, depending on the researchers’ aims and goals. Herein, we discuss the importance of 1) evaluating populations of threatened and endangered bee and wasp species, 2) detecting and identifying pollinators of crops, 3) identifying and managing wasp species for use as biological control agents, 4) surveying the ranges of non-native bees and wasps, and 5) utilizing bees and wasps as biological indicators. We also discuss strategies for the selection of surveying and monitoring tools and methodologies best suited to specific goals and situations in beneficial Hymenoptera research. Our hope is that this review will lead to additional bee/wasp survey and monitoring programs and assist researchers with selecting tools and methodologies for the purpose of better understanding these beneficial insects.¡/jats:p¿

T2  - IEEE access : practical innovations, open solutions
AB  - The tracking of flying insects is one of the main challenges in the field of ecosystem and biodiversity protection. In the case of invasive insects such as Asian hornets, extensive considerations must be made in estimating the habitat because of the limitations of available sensors and environmental uncertainty. In this study, we propose an approach for localizing and autonomously tracking radio-tagged flying insects and developing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based robotic system. The extended Kalman filter is applied to the received signal strength emitted from a radio telemetry transmitter to estimate the insect's position while reducing the measurement error and noise. The proposed autonomous tracking strategy involves a method in which the UAV rotates around one point to measure the signal strength and control its position in relation to the direction of the strongest signal. We also designed a system architecture that includes a tracking sensor system and a UAV system for radio-tagged flying insects. The effectiveness of the proposed system for estimating and autonomously tracking the target position was evaluated via numerical dynamics simulation. Furthermore, feasibility tests with unmanned ground vehicle replacements for insects and UAVs were performed to validate the proposed approach. Finally, to verify the UAV system, field tests were conducted to track a fixed radio-tagged flying target on a vast flatland. This study is unique because we propose and validate a novel mobile robot-based tracking system to localize radio tags of flying insects.

T2  - Hymenoptera - Unanswered Questions and Future Directions [Working Title]
AB  - ¡jats:p¿Vespa velutina nigrithorax has become an invasive species since its introduction in Europe, as it is a predator of native fruits and insects, mostly honeybees. In this chapter, the morphology of the Vespa velutina is described together with its life cycle and the morphology of the nest that this hornet builds. The proliferation of this invasive species in Europe and the economic, environmental and human health impact that it produces makes necessary the use of methods for its control. The methods for the inactivation of nest, trapping hornets and minimising the impact on apiaries are the established methods to fight against this species. Behavioural study of these hornets in captivity has been carried out to increase the knowledge on the ethology of Vespa velutina. For this purpose, two secondary nests and one embryonic nest were captured and kept under controlled environmental conditions for up to 13 weeks for the secondary nest and 6 weeks for the embryonic nest. Adaptation to captivity, defence against disturbance, colony evolution and hibernation were the different behaviours observed. The results of this research will allow us to obtain additional information on this species, which are crucial to develop effective control methods for this invasive species.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - Hornets especially from genus Vespa can attack honey bee colonies, causing economic damages to beekeeping. Also, these hornets can cause damages to some crops. Basically, Vespa hornets occur in different parts of the world including Asia, North Africa, and Europe. Recently, the hornet, Vespa velutina, has invaded Europe and considered as a serious pest to beekeeping. This study aimed to investigate the genetic similarities between five Vespa hornets: V. orientalis, V. ducalis, V. mandarinia, V. affinis, and V. velutina depending on analyzing the sequences of mtDNA utilizing bioinformatics. The phylogenetic relationships, segments from the enzymatic digestion, open reading frames, and number of shared gene cluster families were investigated to detect the genetic similarities. Also, specific primers to discriminate between these hornets were designed and tested in silico. The potential infection of these hornets with similar pathogens was emphasized in light of the obtained results.

Detection in apiaries requires visual inspection of clinically symptomatic hives, which is unreliable, with laboratory confirmation required for definitive diagnosis. These methods can be costly, time-consuming, and require access to specialised equipment operated by experienced personnel. Disease confirmation is essential for notifiable diseases to mitigate spread and economic damages; therefore, rapid, sensitive, and specific point of care diagnostics are critical to prevent misdiagnosis and further outbreaks. To improve diagnostic turnaround, we developed a highly sensitive and specific novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection of ¡jats:italic¿P. larvae¡/jats:italic¿ (AFB-LAMP), designed to amplify a small region of the DNA gyrase subunit B gene (GyrB) with 100

TI  - G-space versus e-space: Are hornets (hymenoptera: Vespidae) at equilibrium with honeybees in asia?
AU  - Rahimi, Ehsan
AU  - Jung, Chuleui
T2  - Ecology and evolution
AB  - This study delves into the concept of niche conservatism (NC) and its implications for how hornets (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) and honeybees respond to climate change. Our primary objectives are threefold: firstly, to assess whether distinct environmental niche spaces (E-space) exist between 12 hornets and honeybees like ¡i¿Apis cerana¡/i¿ and ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿ in Asia; Secondly, to explore the degree to which Asian hornets have attained geographic equilibrium alongside honeybee species. Lastly, is to investigate how the geographic niche overlap (G-space) between hornets and honeybees could potentially change under climate change scenarios. To accomplish these goals, we employed ordination and ecological niche modeling techniques to analyze 91 pairs of hornets and honeybees in both geographic (G-space) and environmental (E-space) contexts. Then, we projected the potential impacts of climate change on the future geographic overlap between hornets and honeybees, specifically under the SSP585 climate scenario for the year 2070. Our results demonstrated that the environmental niches (E-space) of hornets and honeybees can be treated as interchangeable, indicating they have similar environmental preferences despite being unrelated taxa. We found that ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ currently exhibits a moderate geographic niche overlap (G-space) of 0.63 with both honeybee species. Meanwhile, ¡i¿Vespa mandarinia¡/i¿ demonstrates an overlap of 0.46 with ¡i¿Apis cerana¡/i¿ and 0.63 with ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿. The overlap of ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ with ¡i¿Apis cerana¡/i¿ might potentially decrease to 0.51 and 0.56 with ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿. For ¡i¿Vespa mandarinia¡/i¿, the overlap could reach 0.41 with ¡i¿Apis cerana¡/i¿ and 0.6 with ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿ under a climate change scenario. This study indicates that the limited spatial overlap between honeybees and hornets across certain areas in Asia is more likely influenced by geographical barriers rather than solely environmental unsuitability for hornets. In this study, we delve into the concept of niche conservatism (NC) and its implications for how hornets (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) and honeybees respond to climate change.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The Yellow-legged Hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) (YLH) is an invasive insect that arrived in Europe in 2004 and is now spread across nine countries. It is a threat to the native entomofauna and harmful to beekeeping and agriculture, as it is a ravenous predator of the European Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) and other pollinating species. Its expansion has been unstoppable and all resources are needed to fight against it, including native vertebrate predators. Among these, the European Bee-eater (Merops apiaster) (EBE) is a potential one, but little is known about its predation on YLH. In a study carried out in Portugal, remains of YHL were detected in EBE nesting sites, which to the best of our knowledge is the first such report. This means that this bird could be one more agent in the biological control of this pest (although research on predation intensity is still needed), in conjunction with other natural predators and other strategies. In the Iberian Peninsula both species are allopatric in vast regions, so the role of EBE may be more limited. However, in the rest of Europe, at a country or continent scale, the scenario may be different and sympatry may occur to a greater extent.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - The four honeybee species native to Cambodia-¡i¿Apis dorsata¡/i¿, ¡i¿Apis cerana¡/i¿, ¡i¿Apis florea¡/i¿, ¡i¿and Apis andreniformis¡/i¿-play a vital role in ecosystem health and agricultural productivity through their pollination activities. Beekeeping in Cambodia has primarily developed around the introduced species ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿. However, it remains underdeveloped compared to neighboring countries, with wild honey collection continuing to play a significant role. Although native bees are not at immediate risk of extinction, their crucial ecological and socio-economic roles, coupled with the threats to their populations, necessitate the urgent implementation of conservation policies. The beekeeping sector in Cambodia faces numerous challenges that hinder its development. These include a lack of documentation and official data, limited access to productive apiaries, inappropriate pesticide practices, insufficient knowledge about bee health, diseases, and parasites, inadequate organization and representation of beekeepers, the high cost of Cambodian honey, and a lack of consumer awareness and trust in local bee products. This paper provides an overview of the status and distribution of honeybee species, along with the production, value chain, and trade of bee products in Cambodia. It examines the challenges of conserving native honeybees and developing the beekeeping sector while proposing strategies to strengthen bee conservation and support the growth of beekeeping in the country. Key recommendations focus on integrating bee conservation strategies with broader conservation goals, such as reducing deforestation, promoting sustainable agriculture, and regulating the consumption of wild bee brood. Key strategies for the development of beekeeping are documenting and conserving bee floral resources and habitats, reducing the use of bee-toxic pesticides, developing research and training capacities in beekeeping, regulating bee imports, and enhancing quality and authenticity testing facilities. Additionally, building capacity among honey value chain stakeholders in areas such as quality control, authenticity, processing, packaging, and marketing is essential.

AB  - The yellow-legged hornet Vespa velutina Lepeletier 1836, accidentally introduced into France in 2004, is rapidly colonizing other European countries. In Italy the species is spreading throughout the northwest part of the country. Setting up management plans for controlling invasive alien species requires an understanding of the spread modalities and distribution range of the species, information currently not available for the yellow-legged hornet in Italy. The aims of this work are to reconstruct the spread of the yellow-legged hornet from its first arrival in the country, evaluating its distribution range and spread modalities. The area occupied by the species increased from 205 km2 in 2013 to 930 km2 in 2015. In 2015 the frontline of the species was at 55 km along the coast from the French border, with a linear spread of 18.3 ± 3.3 km/year. A human-mediated dispersion could be recognized in different occasions. A cluster analysis of the range allowed the identification of 17 core areas used by the species, with a mean nest density of 2.9–3.5 nests/km2. These details are fundamental to improve control plans and to establish an early warning and rapid response system for the yellow-legged hornet in Italy and, therefore, setup an effective management plan for the species.

AB  - Pressures on honey bee health have substantially increased both colony mortality and beekeepers' costs for hive management across Europe. Although technological advances could offer cost-effective solutions to these challenges, there is little research into the incentives and barriers to technological adoption by beekeepers in Europe. Our study is the first to investigate beekeepers' willingness to adopt the Bee Health Card, a molecular diagnostic tool developed within the PoshBee EU project which can rapidly assess bee health by monitoring molecular changes in bees. The Bee Health Card, based on MALDI BeeTyping®, is currently on level six of the Technology Readiness Level scale, meaning that the technology has been demonstrated in relevant environments. Using an on-line survey from seven European countries, we show that beekeepers recognise the potential for the tool to improve colony health, and that targeted economic incentives, such as subsidises, may help reduce cost being a barrier to the adoption and frequent use of the tool. Based on the description of the tool, 43

AB  - ¡jats:title¿Abstract¡/jats:title¿¡jats:p¿Beekeeping activity is a privileged lens for looking at the impacts of climate change since this human activity is profoundly and intimately embedded in the local ecology with particular reference to the flora. Therefore, we conducted 47 semi-structured interviews to identify the local perceptions of climate change impacts and their drivers among beekeepers of Liguria, a mountainous region of NW Italy. We found that beekeepers especially noticed changes in bee productivity and behaviour and melliferous flora productivity. Moreover, drought is a significant driver of changes in beekeeping as it affects both bees and melliferous plants. However, other drivers, namely alien species, pesticide spread, and abandonment of small-scale agriculture, also concur synergistically. We conclude that landscape planning sensitive to the needs and requests of beekeepers can further contribute to their adaptation to the impacts of climate change and reduce other detrimental phenomena on honeybee wellbeing by supporting small-scale agriculture to maintain a diverse landscape that provides fodder for pollinators.¡/jats:p¿

AB  - In 2004, Vespa velutina was first seen in France. Since then, this fierce honey bee predator spread across many countries, giving rise to one of the most phenomenal insect invasions in Europe. An early study in France showed a genetically depauperate population, originating from a single multi-mated queen introduced from China. Here, we further unveil V. velutina invasion genetics in Europe by surveying the Iberian and Italian peninsulas using cytonuclear markers. Our results show that the French population acted as the colonists’ source in Spain, Portugal and Italy, leading to rejecting the hypothesis of multiple introductions from the native range. While Spain and Italy were colonized predominantly by leading-edge expansions from the French core population, in Portugal the invasion started from long-distance jump. Both processes were accompanied by a significant reduction in genetic diversity, with stronger losses for Portugal (Ar = 17.4

AB  - In this study, honeybee viruses were identified in naturally infected honeybee colonies (¡i¿Apis mellifera carnica¡/i¿). From nine selected samples of clinically affected and ten samples of healthy honeybee colonies, different strains of honeybee viruses were first detected using quantitative real-time RT-PCR methods. Twenty-two nucleotide sequences of the complete genomes of honeybee viruses were identified using the Illumina Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) method: acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) (n = 4), black queen cell virus (BQCV) (n = 3), chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) (n = 2), deformed wing virus (DWV) (n = 5), Lake Sinai virus (LSV) (n = 4), sacbrood bee virus (SBV) (n = 1), Apis rhabdovirus-1 (ARV-1) (n = 1), bee macula-like virus (BeeMLV) (n = 1) and Hubei partiti-like virus 34 (HPLV34) (n = 1). The nucleotide sequences of ABPV, BQCV, DWV and SBV are the first complete genomes of these viruses identified in Slovenia and they represent an important contribution to our understanding of the genetic diversity of honeybee viruses. ARV-1, BeeMLV and HPLV34 were detected and sequenced for the first time in Slovenia.

AB  - The Asian hornet ¡i¿Vespa velutina¡/i¿ is a social predator that has invaded several countries of Europe and Asia, impacting pollinators, apiculture and human health. One of the few effective control methods developed so far is the early destruction of nests. However, they are often built within dense vegetation, being difficult to detect. The aim of the method described here is to detect nests with a simple procedure, utilizing readily available materials, for widespread use in infested areas. The method has two phases, the first phase involves capturing and marking hornets, lured to a protein bait, and recording the flight directions of individuals to the nest and the time needed to complete a bait-nest-bait round trip, to estimate the distance. Collecting this information from two (or more) bait stations allows to delineate the approximate location of the nest. The second phase aims to determine the precise location of the nest, using sugary baits in the vicinity of the nest and conspicuous marks attached to the released hornets, to visually follow them up to their nest. This method is an alternative to other methods that are either ineffective in areas with high nest density or require expensive equipment and specialized training.

AB  - The yellow-legged or Asian hornet (Vespa velutina colour form nigrithorax) was introduced into France from China over a decade ago. Vespa velutina has since spread rapidly across Europe, facilitated by suitable climatic conditions and the ability of a single nest to disperse many mated queens over a large area. Yellow-legged hornets are a major concern because of the potential impact they have on populations of many beneficial pollinators, most notably the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), which shows no effective defensive behaviours against this exotic predator. Here, we present the first report of this species in Great Britain. Actively foraging hornets were detected at two locations, the first around a single nest in Gloucestershire, and the second a single hornet trapped 54 km away in Somerset. The foraging activity observed in Gloucestershire was largely restricted to within 700 m of a single nest, suggesting highly localised movements. Genetic analyses of individuals from the Gloucestershire nest and the single hornet from Somerset suggest that these incursions represent an expansion of the European population, rather than a second incursion from Asia. The founding queen of the Gloucestershire nest mated with a single male, suggesting that sexual reproduction may have occurred in an area of low nest density. Whilst the nest contained diploid adult males, haploid 'true' males were only present at the egg stage, indicating that the nest was detected and removed before the production of queens. Members of the public reported additional dead hornets associated with camping equipment recently returned from France and imported timber products, highlighting possible pathways of incursion. The utility of microsatellites to inform surveillance during an incursion and the challenge of achieving eradication of this damaging pest are discussed.

AB  - Vespa velutina, or Asian yellow-legged hornet, was accidentally introduced from China to other parts of the world: South Korea in 2003, Europe in 2004, and Japan in 2012. V. velutina represents a serious threat to native pollinators. It is known to be a fierce predator of honey bees, but can also hunt wild bees, native wasps, and other flying insects. When V. velutina colonies are developed, many hornets capture foraging bees which are coming back to their hives, causing an increase in homing failure and paralysis of foraging thus leading to colony collapse. The hornets may enter weak beehives to prey on brood and pillage honey. Unlike Apis cerana, Apis mellifera is unable to cope with the predation pressure of V. velutina. Monitoring the spread of an invasive alien species is crucial to plan appropriate management actions and activities to limit the expansion of the species. In addition, an early detection of V. velutina in areas far away from the expansion front allows a rapid response aimed to remove these isolated populations before the settlement of the species. Where V. velutina is now established, control measures to prevent colony losses must be implemented with an integrated pest management approach.

T2  - Open Journal of Ecology
AB  - The Yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina , was accidentally introduced in France in 2004, and then spread rapidly through the French territory but also to adjacent European countries (Spain, Portugal, and Belgium). During summer and autumn, V. velutina workers hunt domestic honeybees, Apis mellifera, for feeding their larvae. The impact of this alien species is mainly economic, beekeepers experiencing heavy colony losses, but also ecological, V. velutina hunting other pollinators. In their year-round life cycle, nest initiation by single queen during spring is the critical stage. In invaded areas, spring queen trapping using food baits has been promoted by apicultural unions in order to limit V. velutina population expansion. The goals of this work were 1) to evaluate the yield of this method, 2) to identify appropriate sites for trapping, 3) to identify potential optimal climatic windows of capture, and 4) to quantify the impact on local entomofauna. Our results showed that water proximity enhances trapping but not beehives proximity, and that trapping is inefficient if average week temperatures are below 10°C. Although the trapping effect on biodiversity should be studied more carefully, spring queen trapping is highly questionable unless specific attractants could be proposed.

AB  - Vespa Velutina (Vespidae family, Genus Vespa) (VV) is a wasp whose origin is Asia. It was first found in Europe by the end of 2005 in southern France, even though its arrival probably took place in Bordeaux in a wood container one year before. Since then, they have spread throughout 32 departments in France, getting to Guipuzcoa by 2011 and are already present in Navarre, attacking beehives, causing damages and social concern. We describe the clinical and etiological study carried out in 8 patients who suffered reactions (7 Systemic and 1 Large Local reaction (LLR) after VV stings.) • After a thorough history we performed: • Skin tests with Apis mellifera, Vespula and Polistes dominulus spp commercial extracts • Total IgE and baseline Tryptase determinations • Specific IgE against full extract of Apis mellifera, Vespula spp, Polistes dominulus and Vespa crabro. • Specific IgE against components using ImmunoCAP with Api m1, Pol d5, Ves Ves v1 and v5 • A sample of VV venom (Spring Mills, PA, USA) was obtained and a IgE - immunoblotting performed using the individual serum of the patients. • 7 patients suffered systemic reactions grade IV and one a LLR. • 5 patients had positive skin tests with other vespid venom extracts • We detected specific IgE to complete extract from other vespids in 6 patients. • All the patients but one with a LLR recognized a protein of 23 kDa in the venom of VV. This protein was specifically recognized by anti-Ves v5 antibodies, indicating that it was the VV antigen 5 (Ves ve5). The amino acid sequence of seven tryptic peptides to Ves ve5 showed 70-100

T2  - NeoBiota : advancing research on alien species and biological invasions
AB  - The Asian yellow-legged hornet ( Vespa velutina ) has been invading Italy since 2013, and it was subjected to management programs to counter its spread and raise awareness about its impacts. We administered a questionnaire to a sample of 358 beekeepers in Italy, asking them about their sources of information on V. velutina and their perception of its potential impacts and severity, compared to other threats to beekeeping. We also explored Internet searching volumes on Google and Wikipedia about V. velutina , to identify seasonal and long-term trends in public awareness. Workshops, journals or bulletins, the Internet and word-of-mouth with colleagues were the primary sources of information about V. velutina . Internet searches peaked during the activity period of the species and increased over time, with thousands of visits to Wikipedia each month. Beekeepers believed V. velutina to affect beekeeping by predating on honey bees ( Apis mellifera ), paralyzing foraging, reducing honey availability and depleting the winter cluster. Moreover, V. velutina has been deemed a severe threat to beekeeping, similar to other threats like pesticides and the varroa mite ( Varroa destructor ). Our findings indicate that beekeepers seem to be aware of the potential impacts of V. velutina in Italy, both within and outside of its invaded area, considering it a major threat to beekeeping. Moreover, citizens seem to have become progressively curious about the species. Information campaigns on the Internet and specialized magazines might be helpful to communicate about the impacts of the species, and the need to develop diffused surveillance networks.

T2  - Scientific Reports
AB  - Abstract Social insects are very successful invasive species, and the continued increase of global trade and transportation has exacerbated this problem. The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax (henceforth Asian hornet), is drastically expanding its range in Western Europe. As an apex insect predator, this hornet poses a serious threat to the honey bee industry and endemic pollinators. Current suppression methods have proven too inefficient and expensive to limit its spread. Gene drives might be an effective tool to control this species, but their use has not yet been thoroughly investigated in social insects. Here, we built a model that matches the hornet’s life history and modelled the effect of different gene drive scenarios on an established invasive population. To test the broader applicability and sensitivity of the model, we also incorporated the invasive European paper wasp Polistes dominula . We find that, due to the haplodiploidy of social hymenopterans, only a gene drive targeting female fertility is promising for population control. Our results show that although a gene drive can suppress a social wasp population, it can only do so under fairly stringent gene drive-specific conditions. This is due to a combination of two factors: first, the large number of surviving offspring that social wasp colonies produce make it possible that, even with very limited formation of resistance alleles, such alleles can quickly spread and rescue the population. Second, due to social wasp life history, infertile individuals do not compete with fertile ones, allowing fertile individuals to maintain a large population size even when drive alleles are widespread. Nevertheless, continued improvements in gene drive technology may make it a promising method for the control of invasive social insects in the future.

AB  - Understanding the major mechanisms that allow an alien species to become invasive is crucial for limiting the impact of such species, and individual immunity seems to be a crucial trait for their large range colonization when introduced to a new area.Indeed, a high resistance to pathogens and parasites could favour the establishment and proliferation of an alien species in a newly colonized region.A striking example of recent successful invasion is represented by the Asian hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, which has invaded Western Europe threatening bees and beekeeping activities.Investigating the biology of this species is fundamental to understand how V. velutina nigrithorax has become invasive in Europe and this knowledge could be crucial for limiting its impact.Here, by performing bacterial challenge bioassays, we compare the immune competence of different castes and sex of a population of the invasive Asian hornet, V. velutina nigri thorax, and of the native European hornet, V. crabro.Our results demonstrate that the two species differ in their immunocompetence with respect to caste: a higher level of immunocompetence was found in the reproductive females of the Asian hornet which were resistant to bacterial challenge when compared to workers and males of both species and to reproductive females of the native European hornet.The high pathogen resistance in reproductive females of the Asian hornet, might therefore represent a key factor contributing to the ecological success and spread of this invader.

We compiled records of off-season swarming of the Japanese honey bee (¡jats:italic¿Apis cerana japonica¡/jats:italic¿) between autumn and winter to improve our understanding of the impact of climate change on the subspecies’ swarming phenology. Based on a survey of 311 beekeepers, eleven off-season swarming records were collected, with ten of them are from 2020 onward. The beekeepers who reported off-season swarming records had eight to twenty years of beekeeping experience, and they declared that they were witnessing off-season swarming for the first time, suggesting a recent increase. One possible factor contributing to the increase in off-season swarming is the temperature rise, as average autumn and winter temperatures in Japan have been increasing.¡/jats:p¿

TI  - Winter weather predicts honey bee colony loss at the national scale
AU  - Overturf, Nathalie; Molinari, Kaj A.; Steinhauer
T2  - Ecological Indicators
AB  - Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) have experienced elevated rates of colony loss over the past decade. Past studies have attempted to determine what factors are behind these losses; however, few have considered the effects of environmental variables; key drivers in ecological systems. Existing investigations were conducted at local spatial scales, over small geographic areas, and failed to measure how environmental variables may influence colony loss rates differently across space. Here, we sought to determine the ability of environmental variables to explain honey bee colony winter loss rates across the contiguous U.S. over a nine-year study period, while elucidating how spatial methods produce results which differ from non-spatial approaches. To conduct this study, loss data from stationary beekeepers were obtained from the Bee Informed Partnership's national Colony Loss and Management Survey for winters spanning from 2011 to 2019 and were aggregated by zip code. Environmental data (i.e., temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, elevation) were obtained from PRISM, the Global Wind Atlas, and the U.S. Geological Survey, and averaged by month across the study period. Environmental variables and loss were regressed using linear and geographically weighted regressions. Results demonstrated that effects of environmental variables on colony loss varied across space, indicating that spatial models should be used when studying honey bee colony losses. Additionally, we found that increased winter colony loss rates were linked to lower November mean maximum temperatures and less February mean precipitation, thus, these two variables may be good predictors of observed winter loss rates. Finally, results also revealed that weather conditions during winter months were better predictors of winter colony loss than conditions during other months of the year. Overall, our results illustrate how environmental factors strongly impact managed honey bees and highlight the importance of regionally specific management practices to help prevent losses in the future.

AB  - Beekeepers in the United States have experienced high losses of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies for more than a decade. Long-term, multi-year monitoring efforts are crucial to provide a temporal and spatial context to these losses. To document and explain these losses, the Bee Informed Partnership has conducted national surveys on managed honey bee colonies since spring 2011, continuing the work of surveys first commissioned by the Apiary Inspectors of America in spring 2007. Here we present survey results from three years – 2017–18, 2018–19, and 2019–20. Each year, colony loss rates were estimated and compared among three loss periods – summer, winter, and annual – and three beekeeping operation types based on their number of colonies managed – backyard (≤50 colonies), sideline (51-500 colonies), and commercial (¿500 colonies). At the national level, we recorded the highest winter colony loss rates (37.7

AU  - Pavlović, Biljana; Šokarda Slavić, Ratko; Dojnov
T2  - Journal of Apicultural Research
AB  - Finding a pollen substitute for honey bees that is nutritionally adequate and affordable is a scientific and practical challenge. We attempted a new rational approach and tried to exploit honey bees' natural cannibalistic behavior. We tested processed insect larvae as a food source that is nutritionally similar to bee brood, and which can easily be produced on a large scale. In cage experiments, monitoring bee mortality, food consumption and changes in bee body parts' weights showed that flour obtained by grinding dried yellow mealworm larvae has the potential to become an excellent component for pollen substitution. Bees from the cage group fed Tenebrio molitor patties (TG) demonstrated overall best results in comparison to sugar patties fed bee group (CG), yeast patties fed bee group (YG) and pollen patties fed bee group (PG). They did not lose weight as rapidly as the CG, did not defecate inside cages as the YG, nor show increased mortality as the PG. At the same time, TG consumed less food (mean 13.7 g/cage) than CG (16.8 g/cage), YG (20.4 g/cage) and PG (23.9 g/cage) within the period of 28 days. Bees' gut increase in weight was lowest in the CG, followed by TG and PG and was the highest in the YG which resulted in diarrhea after 14 days. Bees from TG did not lag behind other bees in head, thorax and abdomen weight after 28 days. We demonstrated that processed yellow mealworm larvae (T. molitor) can be used as an ingredient for honey bee feed.

TI  - Parasites and pesticides act antagonistically on honey bee health
AU  - Bird, Alan E.; Williams, Gwendolyn; Wilson
T2  - Journal of Applied Ecology
AB  - Pesticides and parasites have each been linked to increased mortality in western honey bees (Apis mellifera). Currently, it is uncertain if one makes the other worse; several studies have tested for potential synergistic stressor effects, but results have been mixed. Here, we use a hierarchical meta‐analysis of 63 experiments from 26 studies to gain a clearer view of the combined effects of parasites and pesticides on honey bee health. We found that combined pesticide–parasite treatments do tend to be deadlier than uncombined treatments but are significantly less deadly than predicted additive or multiplicative effects. In other words, combined treatment effects are not synergistic, but antagonistic. Much of the previous uncertainty about the combined effects of pesticides and parasites on honey bee health can be attributed to a bias in the previous research against stressor antagonism; many researchers have excluded the possibility of antagonism a priori. Synthesis and applications. Meta‐analysis shows that when honey bees are stressed by a combination of pesticides and parasites, the combined stress effect is antagonistic, that is, less than the sum of its parts. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this antagonism could prove critical for effective management of honey bee health.

TI  - Synergistic and antagonistic interactions between varroa destructor mites and neonicotinoid insecticides in male apis mellifera honey bees
AU  - Bruckner, Lars; Neumann, Selina; Straub
T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Pressures from multiple, sometimes interacting, stressors have negative consequences to important ecosystem-service providing species like the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) (hereafter honey bee). The introduced parasite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid class of insecticides each represent important, nearly ubiquitous biotic and abiotic stressors to honey bees, respectively. Previous research demonstrated that they synergistically interact to negatively affect non-reproductive honey bee females (workers), but no data exist on how concurrent exposure may affect reproductive honey bee males (drones). This is important, given that the health of reproductive females (queens), possibly because of poor mating, is frequently cited as a major driver of honey bee colony loss. To address this, known age cohorts of drones were obtained from 12 honey bee colonies – seven were exposed to field-relevant concentrations of two neonicotinoids (4.5ppb thiamethoxam and 1.5ppb clothianidin) during development via supplementary pollen patties; five colonies received patties not spiked with neonicotinoids. Artificially emerged drones were assessed for natural V. destructor infestation, weighed, and then allocated to the appropriate treatment group: 1. Control, 2. V. destructor only, 3. Neonicotinoid only, and 4. Combined. Adult drones were maintained in laboratory cages alongside attendant workers (1 drone : 2 worker ratio) until they reached sexual maturity at 14 days post-emergence so sperm quality could be assessed. We found that V. destructor and neonicotinoids interacted synergistically to negatively affect adult drone survival, but that they interacted antagonistically on emergence mass. Although sample sizes were too low to assess the effects of V. destructor and combined exposure on sperm quality, we observed no influence of neonicotinoids on sperm quantity or viability. Our findings highlight the diverse effects of concurrent exposure to stressors on honey bees, and suggest that V. destructor and neonicotinoids can severely effect the number of mature adult drones available for mating.

T2  - The Science of the total environment
AB  - A primary goal in biology is to understand the effects of multiple, interacting environmental stressors on organisms. Wild and domesticated bees are exposed to a wide variety of interacting biotic and abiotic stressors, with widespread declines in floral resources and agrochemical exposure being two of the most important. In this study, we used examinations of brain gene expression to explore the sublethal consequences of neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and pollen diet composition in nest-founding bumble bee queens. We demonstrate for the first time that pollen diet composition can influence the strength of bumble bee queen responses to pesticide exposure at the molecular level. Specifically, one pollen mixture in our study appeared to buffer bumble bee queens entirely against the effects of pesticide exposure, with respect to brain gene expression. Additionally, we detected unique effects of pollen diet and sustained (versus more temporary) pesticide exposure on queen gene expression. Our findings support the hypothesis that nutritional status can help buffer animals against the harmful effects of other stressors, including pesticides, and highlight the importance of using molecular approaches to explore sublethal consequences of stressors.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿Bees are the most important pollinators of agricultural plants. The decline of bee colonies is caused by a multitude of factors of which diseases, pesticides, and climate change seem to be the most important. Losses can be huge when several factors act together. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of alternative sources such as medicinal plants in the form of extracts or essential oils. The purpose of our research was to evaluate the economic efficiency of the use of essential oils of basil (Ocimum basilicum), cinnamon (Cinnamomum veruum), clove (Syzgium aromaticum), juniper (Juniperus communis L.), oregano (Oreganum vulgare), mint (Mentha piperita), rosemary (Rosmarius officinalis), and thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) in the additional feeding of bee colonies in the spring. Ninety colonies of Apis mellifera bees were used, which were additionally fed with sugar syrup and one of the essential oils. Our results showed strong positive correlations between the total number of germs in the gut of worker bees and the number of brood cells when using the essential oil of oregano (Oreganum vulgare) (R2 = 0.786) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) (R2 = 0.729), and between the total number of germs and the yield of honey obtained at the first harvest in the case of the essential oil of basil (Ocimum basilicum) (R2 = 1), mint (Mentha piperita) (R2 = 0.718), oregano (Oreganum vulgare) (R2 = 0.621), and Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L) (R2 = 0.859).

AU  - Franco-Campos, Mónica; Rodríguez-Carrasco, Felipe; Fernández-Franzón
T2  - Toxicology
AB  - In recent years, spheroids (tridimensional cell cultures) have emerged as a more physiologically relevant replacement for monolayer models. Their distinctive advantage is the formation of an extracellular matrix that facilitates enhanced cellular interaction and communication, approximating the conditions observed in vivo. Therefore, the potential for conducting intricate cellular and molecular techniques in these models could offer a more precise assessment of pivotal proteins within various cellular pathways of interest. Amitraz (AMZ), an acaricide classified as a formamidine chemical, has been detected in honey at concentrations exceeding legal limits. The objective of this study was to characterize a spheroid model of SH-SY5Y cells and determine the cytotoxic effect of AMZ and its mechanisms of action on this spheroid. The formation of mature spheroids was observed on the seventh day following seeding. The results obtained with SH-SY5Y spheroids were an IC¡sub¿50¡/sub¿ of 238.8 ± 17 µM and 224.3 ± 19 µM, respectively, after 24 and 48 h of exposure by the MTT assay. The findings revealed that AMZ did not exhibit any indications of inflammatory over-expression markers in the spheroids. Nevertheless, at 238.8 µM of AMZ, an increase incidence of late apoptosis within spheroid cells and Bcl-2 protein expression in peripheral spheroid cells were observed through annexin V and propidium iodide probe and immunofluorescence analysis. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that spheroids could be useful for an accurate assessment of toxicity, representing a viable alternative method for determining the mechanisms of action of AMZ and related compounds.

This research was carried out to cover possible sublethal GBH effects on the brood and colony development, adult survival, and overwintering success of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) under field conditions. Residues in bee relevant matrices, such as nectar, pollen, and plants, were additionally measured. To address these questions, we adopted four independent study approaches. For brood effects and survival, we orally exposed mini-hives housed in the “Kieler mating-nuc” system to sublethal concentrations of 4.8 mg glyphosate/kg (T1, low) and 137.6 mg glyphosate/kg (T2, high) over a period of one brood cycle (21 days). Brood development and colony conditions were assessed after a modified OECD method (No. 75). For adult survival, we weighed and labeled freshly emerged workers from control and exposed colonies and introduced them into non-contaminated mini-hives to monitor their life span for 25 consecutive days. The results from these experiments showed a trivial effect of GBH on colony conditions and the survival of individual workers, even though the hatching weight was reduced in T2. The brood termination rate (BTR) in the T2 treatment, however, was more than doubled (49.84

TI  - Overlapping exposure effects of pathogen and dimethoate on honeybee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) metabolic rate and longevity.
AU  - Pent, Sigmar; Raimets, Kaarel; Naudi
T2  - Frontiers in physiology
AB  - ¡b¿Introduction:¡/b¿ Declines in honeybee abundance have been observed worldwide during last decades. This is partly due to plant protection agents used in intensive farming, landscaping and infrastructure maintenance. Another type of factors negatively affecting honeybees is the spread of diseases caused by different pathogens and pests. Lately, more focus has been paid to the interactions between different overlapping stressors affecting honeybee health, the combination of these often being more detrimental compared to individual stressors. The most widely used stress-evaluating methods take into account lethal- or motorial changes of the individuals or colonies. Comparatively little honeybee research has examined changes in initial recovery potential and physiological symptoms of toxification. The aim of this study was to examine the combined effect of ¡i¿Nosema apis¡/i¿ and ¡i¿N. ceranae¡/i¿ (according to a newer classification ¡i¿Vairimorpha apis¡/i¿ and ¡i¿V. ceranae¡/i¿), the common causes of nosemosis in the honeybee ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿ L., with the insecticide dimethoate. ¡b¿Methods:¡/b¿ In this study, honeybee mortality and metabolic rate were used to assess the combined effects interactions of ¡i¿Nosema¡/i¿ ssp. and dimethoate. ¡b¿Results:¡/b¿ Our results showed that exposure to the low concentration of either dimethoate, either one or both species of ¡i¿Nosema¡/i¿ ssp as single factors or in the combination had no significant effect on honeybee metabolic rate. The mortality increased with the two ¡i¿Nosema¡/i¿ spp., as well as with infection by ¡i¿N. ceranae¡/i¿ alone. The effect of dimethoate was observed only in combination with ¡i¿N. apis¡/i¿ infection, which alone had no effect on individual honeybee mortality. ¡b¿Conclusion:¡/b¿ This study demonstrates that the overlapping exposure to a non-lethal concentration of a pesticide and a pathogen can be hidden by stronger stressor but become observable with milder stressors.

AU  - Morii, Yoshiko, Kiyohito; Sakamoto
T2  - Die Naturwissenschaften
AB  - The impacts of temperature increase are a concern for honey bees, which are major pollinators of crops and wild plants. Swarming is the reproductive behavior of honey bees that increases colony numbers. Honey bee colonies sometimes swarm multiple times, with each swarming termed a "swarming event" and a series of these events called a "swarming cycle." The number of swarming events per swarming cycle varies widely depending on climatic conditions and subspecies, and the recent temperature increase due to global warming might be affecting the number of swarming events per swarming cycle of native honey bees. We clarified long-term changes in the number of swarming events per swarming cycle of Japanese honey bees (Apis cerana japonica) by collecting beekeepers' swarming logbooks. The survey showed that between 2000 and 2022, Japanese honey bees swarmed 1 to 8 times per swarming cycle. Generalized linear model analysis indicated that year had a significant positive effect (coefficient, 0.03; 95

TI  - Negative but antagonistic effects of neonicotinoid insecticides and ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor on Apis mellifera honey bee food glands.
AU  - Bruckner, Lars; Neumann, Selina; Straub
T2  - Chemosphere
AB  - Collaborative brood care by workers is essential for the functionality of eusocial Apis mellifera honey bee colonies. The hypopharyngeal food glands of workers play a crucial role in this context. Even though there is consensus that ubiquitous ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and widespread insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, are major stressors for honey bee health, their impact alone and in combination on the feeding glands of workers is poorly understood. Here, we show that combined exposure to V. destructor and neonicotinoids antagonistically interacted on hypopharyngeal gland size, yet they did not interact on emergence body mass or survival. While the observed effects of the antagonistic interaction were less negative than expected based on the sum of the individual effects, hypopharyngeal gland size was still significantly reduced. Alone, V. destructor parasitism negatively affected emergence body mass, survival, and hypopharyngeal gland size, whereas neonicotinoid exposure reduced hypopharyngeal gland size only. Since size is associated with hypopharyngeal gland functionality, a reduction could result in inadequate brood care. As cooperative brood care is a cornerstone of eusociality, smaller glands could have adverse down-stream effects on inclusive fitness of honey bee colonies. Therefore, our findings highlight the need to further study how ubiquitous stressors like V. destructor and neonicotinoids interact to affect honey bees.

T2  - Journal of economic entomology
AB  - Pollination by insects is vital for global agriculture, with honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) being the most important pollinators. Honey bees are exposed to numerous stressors, including disease, pesticides, and inadequate nutrition, resulting in significant colony losses. This study investigates the use of drone brood to mitigate these problems. Drone brood, which is normally discarded during varroa mite (Varroa destructor, Anderson and Trueman) management, is rich in proteins, fats, and essential minerals. We compared drone brood with an already suggested pollen supplement (Tenebrio [Tenebrio molitor L.] flour). The results indicate that drone brood flour is a viable source of proteins, fats, and minerals and is potentially antimicrobial due to its high content of elements with known antimicrobial properties. It meets the nutritional needs of honey bees while mitigating the effects of varroa mites. The use of drone brood flour can provide high-quality beeswax, surplus of pollen, and improve bee health, which promotes sustainable beekeeping.

AU  - Kady, Anna Maria; Kortbawi, Charbel; Chedid
T2  - Diversity
AB  - The internet of things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 technologies are becoming widely used in the field of apiculture to enhance honey production and reduce colony losses using connected scales combined with additional data, such as relative humidity and internal temperature. This paper exploits beehive weight measurements and builds appropriate business rules using two instruments. The first is an IoT fixed scale installed on one hive, taking rich continuous measurements, and used as a reference. The second is a portable nomad scale communicating with a smartphone and used for the remaining hives. A key contribution will be the run and triggering of a business process model based on apicultural business rules learned from experience and system observed events. Later, the evolution of the weight of each individual hive, obtained by either measurement or inference, will be associated with a graphical workflow diagram expressed with the business process model and notation (BPMN) language, and will trigger events that inform beekeepers to initiate relevant action. Finally, the BPMN processes will be transformed into executable models for model driven decision support. This contribution improves amateur and professional user-experience for honeybee keeping and opens the door for interoperability between the suggested model and other available simulations (weather, humidity, bee colony behavior, etc.).

AU  - Reiner, Matthias C; Grimm, Dominik; Spangenberg
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are important pollinators for wild plants as well as for crops, but honeybee performance is threatened by several stressors including varroa mites, gaps in foraging supply, and pesticides. The consequences of bee colony longtime exposure to multiple stressors are not well understood. The vast number of possible stressor combinations and necessary study duration require research comprising field, laboratory, and simulation experiments. We simulated long-term exposure of a honeybee colony to the insecticide imidacloprid and to varroa mites carrying the deformed wing virus in landscapes with different temporal gaps in resource availability as single stressors and in combinations. Furthermore, we put a strong emphasis on chronic lethal, acute sublethal, and acute lethal effects of imidacloprid on honeybees. We have chosen conservative published values to parameterize our model (e.g., highest reported imidacloprid contamination). As expected, combinations of stressors had a stronger negative effect on bee performance than each single stressor alone, and effect sizes were larger after 3 years of exposure than after the first year. Imidacloprid-caused reduction in bee performance was almost exclusively due to chronic lethal effects because the thresholds for acute effects were rarely met in simulations. In addition, honeybee colony extinctions were observed by the last day of the first year but more pronounced on the last days of the second and third simulation year. In conclusion, our study highlights the need for more long-term studies on chronic lethal effects of pesticides on honeybees. Environ Toxicol Chem 2022;41:2318-2327. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - ¡jats:p¿The decline of pollinators, particularly Apis mellifera, seriously threatens global ecosystems and agricultural productivity. This study investigated the effects of environmental stress (low vegetation cover, high internal hive temperatures, high internal hive humidity, and high parasitism rate by the mite Varroa destructor) on the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of honey bee wings in seven apiaries in Dom Joaquim, a reference city for wild honey production in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. We evaluated the FA of 18 wing venations of 30 bees from five beehive boxes in seven apiaries, totaling 1050 bees. Our results showed that fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in wing venation traits M4 (P = 0.013), M12 (P = 0.014), M13 (P = 0.020), M14 (P = 0.014), and M18 (P &lt; 0.001) differed significantly among apiaries, likely reflecting variation in local environmental stressors. These differences suggest that site-specific conditions may differentially impact colony stress levels, influencing developmental stability in honey bees.

AB  - Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony loss is a widespread phenomenon with important economic and biological implications, whose drivers are still an open matter of investigation. We contribute to this line of research through a large-scale, multi-variable study combining multiple publicly accessible data sources. Specifically, we analyzed quarterly data covering the contiguous United States for the years 2015-2021, and combined open data on honey bee colony status and stressors, weather data, and land use. The different spatio-temporal resolutions of these data are addressed through an up-scaling approach that generates additional statistical features which capture more complex distributional characteristics and significantly improve modeling performance. Treating this expanded feature set with state-of-the-art feature selection methods, we obtained findings that, nation-wide, are in line with the current knowledge on the aggravating roles of Varroa destructor and pesticides in colony loss. Moreover, we found that extreme temperature and precipitation events, even when controlling for other factors, significantly impact colony loss. Overall, our results reveal the complexity of biotic and abiotic factors affecting managed honey bee colonies across the United States.

AB  - Pesticides pose a potential threat to bee health, especially in combination with other stressors, such as parasites. However, pesticide risk assessment tests pesticides in isolation from other stresses, i.e., on otherwise healthy bees.

Molecular mass profiling by MALDI BeeTyping¡sup¿®¡/sup¿ was used on bee haemolymph to explore the signature of pesticidal and parasitic stressor impacts.

T2  - Insects
AB  - Honey bees (¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿) are agriculturally important pollinators. Over the past decades, significant losses of wild and domestic bees have been reported in many parts of the world. Several biotic and abiotic factors, such as change in land use over time, intensive land management, use of pesticides, climate change, beekeeper's management practices, lack of forage (nectar and pollen), and infection by parasites and pathogens, negatively affect the honey bee's well-being and survival. The gut microbiota is important for honey bee growth and development, immune function, protection against pathogen invasion; moreover, a well-balanced microbiota is fundamental to support honey bee health and vigor. In fact, the structure of the bee's intestinal bacterial community can become an indicator of the honey bee's health status. Lactic acid bacteria are normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of many insects, and their presence in the honey bee intestinal tract has been consistently reported in the literature. In the first section of this review, recent scientific advances in the use of LABs as probiotic supplements in the diet of honey bees are summarized and discussed. The second section discusses some of the mechanisms by which LABs carry out their antimicrobial activity against pathogens. Afterward, individual paragraphs are dedicated to Chalkbrood, American foulbrood, European foulbrood, Nosemosis, and Varroosis as well as to the potentiality of LABs for their biological control.

T2  - Microbiological research
AB  - Honey bees (Apis mellifera) harbour a stable core microbial community within their gut, that is suggested to play a role in metabolic functioning, immune regulation, and host homeostasis. This microbiota presents a unique opportunity to observe the effects of stressors on honey bee health. We examined the effects of two common honey bee stressors: indirect fungicide contamination and nutrient limitation. These effects were observed through changes in their hind- and midgut microbiota using Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA), alongside high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Expression of the honey bees' immune response was examined through the expression of three immune-related genes, namely, immune deficiency (imd), proPhenolOxidase (proPO), and spaetzle (spz). Additionally, longevity of the honey bees was monitored through observation of the expression levels of Vitellogenin (Vg). Both treatment groups were compared to a negative control, and a diseased positive control. There was no effect on the hindgut microbiota due to the stressors, while significant changes in the midgut was observed. This was also observed in the expression of the immune-related genes within the treatment groups. The Imd pathway was substantially downregulated, with upregulation in the prophenoloxidase pathway. However, no significant effect was observed in the expression of spz, and only the pollen treatment group showed reduced longevity through a downregulation of Vg. Overall, the effect of these two common stressors indicate a compromise in honey bee immunity, and potential vulnerabilities within the immune defence mechanisms.

AB  - Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) represent a key mechanism in the thermal adaptation of the honeybee ¡i¿Apis mellifera¡/i¿. In this study, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and qPCR were employed to explore the changes in the methylation states of H3K4m2, H3K4m3, H3K27m2 and H3K27m3 associated with ¡i¿l2efl¡/i¿ (ID: 72474, 724405, 724488), histone methyltransferases (HMTs) ((¡i¿trx¡/i¿) and ¡i¿PR-set7¡/i¿) and Polycomb (¡i¿Pc¡/i¿) and (¡i¿Su¡/i¿(¡i¿z¡/i¿)¡i¿12¡/i¿) genes in ¡i¿A. m. jemenitica¡/i¿ (tolerant subspecies) and ¡i¿A. m. carnica¡/i¿ (susceptible subspecies) in response to heat treatment (42 °C for 1 h). The results revealed significant enrichment fold changes in the methylation/demethylation of most H3K4 and H3K27 marks at all targeted genes. These changes increased the profusion of ¡i¿l2efl¡/i¿ (ID: 72474, 724405, 724488), histone methyltransferases (HMTs) (¡i¿trx)¡/i¿ and Polycomb (¡i¿Pc¡/i¿) and ¡i¿Su(z)12¡/i¿ and decreased the profusion of HMT (¡i¿PR-set7¡/i¿) in both honeybee subspecies. The changes in the methylation enrichment folds of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) ((¡i¿trx), PR-set)¡/i¿ and Polycomb (¡i¿Pc¡/i¿), ¡i¿Su(z)12¡/i¿ genes demonstrate the well-harmonized coordination of epigenetic gene regulation in response to heat treatment. Compared to the control, the changes in the methylation enrichment folds of H3K4m3 at Polycomb ¡i¿Su(z)12¡/i¿ were about 30× and 100× higher in treated ¡i¿A. m. jemenitica¡/i¿ and ¡i¿A.m. carnica,¡/i¿ respectively. Similarly, changes in the methylation/demethylation enrichment folds of HMT (¡i¿trx)¡/i¿ and Polycomb (¡i¿Pc¡/i¿) and ¡i¿Su(z)12¡/i¿ were 2-3× higher in ¡i¿A. m. carnica¡/i¿ than in ¡i¿A. m. jemenitica¡/i¿ after treatment (42 °C). It is evident that post-translational chromatin modification in both honeybee subspecies can diminish heat stress impact by (I) increasing the transcriptional provision of ¡i¿l2efl¡/i¿ associated with survival and (II) increasing the silencing of genes associated with general cellular activities.

AB  - ¡jats:title¿Abstract¡/jats:title¿¡jats:p¿Many of the fruits that add diversity and nutrition to our diet are wholly or partially dependent upon flower‐visiting insects. For example, apples (¡jats:italic¿Malus¡/jats:italic¿ spp.) are self‐incompatible and therefore rely on insect pollinators for fruit development and seed production. Honey bees (¡jats:italic¿Apis mellifera¡/jats:italic¿) are often migrated into these orchards when the apples are in bloom. While previous studies have focused on the impact of honey bees to fruit orchards, fewer studies have examined the reciprocal relationship of the orchards to honey bees, particularly if the bees are in the orchard for the entire foraging season, not just during bloom. Here we investigated the foraging dynamics of honey bees in apple orchards in Virginia for two full foraging seasons (April–October, 2018–2019). We decoded, mapped, and analyzed the waggle dances (¡jats:italic¿n¡/jats:italic¿ = 3710) made by returning foragers, which communicate the distance and direction from the hive to valuable resources, usually nectar or pollen. We found that bees foraged locally at &lt;2 km throughout the season in both 2018 and 2019, with some long‐range recruitment of up to 11 km. Contrary to our expectations, apple blooms did not drive honey bee foraging. We determined in our calculations of percent (

AB  - The extent of our reliance on animal pollination for world crop production for human food has not previously been evaluated and the previous estimates for countries or continents have seldom used primary data. In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60

TI  - The COLOSS BEEBOOK volume I, standard methods for apis mellifera research: Introduction
AU  - Dietemann, James D.; Neumann, Vincent; Ellis
T2  - Journal of Apicultural Research
AB  - The COLOSS BEEBOOK is a practical manual compiling standard methods in all fields of research on the western honey bee, Apis mellifera. The COLOSS network was founded in 2008 as a consequence of the heavy and frequent losses of managed honey bee colonies experienced in many regions of the world (Neumann and Carreck, 2010). As many of the world’s honey bee research teams began to address the problem, it soon became obvious that a lack of standardized research methods was seriously hindering scientists’ ability to harmonize and compare the data on colony losses obtained internationally. In its second year of activity, during a COLOSS meeting held in Bern, Switzerland, the idea of a manual of standardized honey bee research methods emerged. The manual, to be called the COLOSS BEEBOOK, was inspired by publications with similar purposes for fruit fly research (Lindsley and Grell, 1968; Ashburner 1989; Roberts, 1998; Greenspan, 2004).

AU  - Henry, Maxime; Requier, Mickaël; Béguin
T2  - Science (New York, N.Y.)
AB  - Nonlethal exposure of honey bees to thiamethoxam (neonicotinoid systemic pesticide) causes high mortality due to homing failure at levels that could put a colony at risk of collapse. Simulated exposure events on free-ranging foragers labeled with a radio-frequency identification tag suggest that homing is impaired by thiamethoxam intoxication. These experiments offer new insights into the consequences of common neonicotinoid pesticides used worldwide.

TI  - Genetics, synergists, and age affect insecticide sensitivity of the honey bee, apis mellifera
AU  - Rinkevich, Joseph W.; Pittman, Frank D.; Margotta
T2  - PloS one
AB  - The number of honey bee colonies in the United States has declined to half of its peak level in the 1940s, and colonies lost over the winter have reached levels that are becoming economically unstable. While the causes of these losses are numerous and the interaction between them is very complex, the role of insecticides has garnered much attention. As a result, there is a need to better understand the risk of insecticides to bees, leading to more studies on both toxicity and exposure. While much research has been conducted on insecticides and bees, there have been very limited studies to elucidate the role that bee genotype and age has on the toxicity of these insecticides. The goal of this study was to determine if there are differences in insecticide sensitivity between honey bees of different genetic backgrounds (Carniolan, Italian, and Russian stocks) and assess if insecticide sensitivity varies with age. We found that Italian bees were the most sensitive of these stocks to insecticides, but variation was largely dependent on the class of insecticide tested. There were almost no differences in organophosphate bioassays between honey bee stocks (¡1-fold), moderate differences in pyrethroid bioassays (1.5 to 3-fold), and dramatic differences in neonicotinoid bioassays (3.4 to 33.3-fold). Synergism bioassays with piperonyl butoxide, amitraz, and coumaphos showed increased phenothrin sensitivity in all stocks and also demonstrated further physiological differences between stocks. In addition, as bees aged, the sensitivity to phenothrin significantly decreased, but the sensitivity to naled significantly increased. These results demonstrate the variation arising from the genetic background and physiological transitions in honey bees as they age. This information can be used to determine risk assessment, as well as establishing baseline data for future comparisons to explain the variation in toxicity differences for honey bees reported in the literature.

TI  - Covert deformed wing virus infections have long-term deleterious effects on honeybee foraging and survival
AU  - Benaets, Anneleen; Cardoen, Kristof; Van Geystelen
T2  - Proceedings. Biological sciences
AB  - Several studies have suggested that covert stressors can contribute to bee colony declines. Here we provide a novel case study and show using radiofrequency identification tracking technology that covert deformed wing virus (DWV) infections in adult honeybee workers seriously impact long-term foraging and survival under natural foraging conditions. In particular, our experiments show that adult workers injected with low doses of DWV experienced increased mortality rates, that DWV caused workers to start foraging at a premature age, and that the virus reduced the workers' total activity span as foragers. Altogether, these results demonstrate that covert DWV infections have strongly deleterious effects on honeybee foraging and survival. These results are consistent with previous studies that suggested DWV to be an important contributor to the ongoing bee declines in Europe and the USA. Overall, our study underlines the strong impact that covert pathogen infections can have on individual and group-level performance in bees.

TI  - Bee declines driven by combined stress from parasites, pesticides, and lack of flowers
AU  - Goulson, Elizabeth; Botías, Dave; Nicholls
T2  - Science (New York, N.Y.)
AB  - Bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined, bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple, interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but such interactions are not addressed by current regulatory procedures and studying these interactions experimentally poses a major challenge. In the meantime, taking steps to reduce stress on bees would seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich habitat into farmland, reducing pesticide use through adopting more sustainable farming methods, and enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements are all practical measures that should be adopted. Effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies into the future.

TI  - When every sperm counts: factors affecting male fertility in the honeybee Apis mellifera
AU  - Stürup, Barbara; Nash, M.; Baer-Imhoof
T2  - Behavioral Ecology
AB  - Eusocial hymenopteran males have exceptionally high levels of ejaculate quality, which are assumed to result from extreme selection pressures for pre- and postcopulatory male–male competition and the necessity to retain viable sperm after years of storage in female (queen) spermathecae. We hypothesized that the production of high-quality sperm carries substantial costs so that fertility of males may be compromised by stress factors when they are operating at their physiological limits. To test this, we performed a series of experiments using honeybees as our model system, to establish possible effects of male age on sperm quality and to evaluate effects of elevated temperatures, food deprivation during sexual maturation, and immune challenges. We found that sperm viability decreases with male age but that males of some colonies were better able to delay ejaculate senescence than others. Exposure to elevated temperatures and wounding both significantly decreased male fecundity, but protein deficiency after hatching did not. This suggests that investment in drones is completed at pupation and that sexual maturation does not require additional protein feeding. The sensitivity of drone fitness to stress factors related to temperature and immune system activation illustrates that hygienic monitoring and active thermoregulation by workers are essential for colony-level reproductive success. These results underline that honeybee drones have been under strong selection for extreme specialization on reproductive performance and that this precludes any exposure to the stressful conditions that foraging workers normally experience.

AU  - Pisa, V.; Belzunces, L.; Amaral-Rogers
T2  - Environmental science and pollution research international
AB  - We assessed the state of knowledge regarding the effects of large-scale pollution with neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on non-target invertebrate species of terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. A large section of the assessment is dedicated to the state of knowledge on sublethal effects on honeybees (Apis mellifera) because this important pollinator is the most studied non-target invertebrate species. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Lumbricidae (earthworms), Apoidae sensu lato (bumblebees, solitary bees) and the section “other invertebrates” review available studies on the other terrestrial species. The sections on freshwater and marine species are rather short as little is known so far about the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on the diverse invertebrate fauna of these widely exposed habitats. For terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate species, the known effects of neonicotinoid pesticides and fipronil are described ranging from organismal toxicology and behavioural effects to population-level effects. For earthworms, freshwater and marine species, the relation of findings to regulatory risk assessment is described. Neonicotinoid insecticides exhibit very high toxicity to a wide range of invertebrates, particularly insects, and field-realistic exposure is likely to result in both lethal and a broad range of important sublethal impacts. There is a major knowledge gap regarding impacts on the grand majority of invertebrates, many of which perform essential roles enabling healthy ecosystem functioning. The data on the few non-target species on which field tests have been performed are limited by major flaws in the outdated test protocols. Despite large knowledge gaps and uncertainties, enough knowledge exists to conclude that existing levels of pollution with neonicotinoids and fipronil resulting from presently authorized uses frequently exceed the lowest observed adverse effect concentrations and are thus likely to have large-scale and wide ranging negative biological and ecological impacts on a wide range of non-target invertebrates in terrestrial, aquatic, marine and benthic habitats.

Classical and new methods developed to take into account the characteristics and different types of effects of the neonicotinoid insecticides to bees are described. The available toxicity results are critically analyzed. Thus, the nitro-substituted compounds (clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid and its metabolites, thiamethoxam, nitenpyram) appear the most toxic to bees. The cyano-substituted neonicotinoids seem to exhibit a much lower toxicity (acetamiprid and thiacloprid). The chapter ends with suggestions for additional studies aiming at better assess the hazard of this important insecticide family to bees.

T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - Queen health is crucial to colony survival of social bees. Recently, queen failure has been proposed to be a major driver of managed honey bee colony losses, yet few data exist concerning effects of environmental stressors on queens. Here we demonstrate for the first time that exposure to fieldrealistic concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides during development can severely affect queens of western honey bees (Apis mellifera). In pesticide-exposed queens, reproductive anatomy (ovaries) and physiology (spermathecal-stored sperm quality and quantity), rather than flight behaviour, were compromised and likely corresponded to reduced queen success (alive and producing worker offspring). This study highlights the detriments of neonicotinoids to queens of environmentally and economically important social bees, and further strengthens the need for stringent risk assessments to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem services that are vulnerable to these substances.

TI  - Monoterpenoid-based preparations in beehives affect learning, memory, and gene expression in the bee brain.
AU  - Bonnafé, Julie; Hotier, Elsa; Alayrangues
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Bees are exposed in their environment to contaminants that can weaken the colony and contribute to bee declines. Monoterpenoid-based preparations can be introduced into hives to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. The long-term effects of monoterpenoids are poorly investigated. Olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) has been used to evaluate the impact of stressors on cognitive functions of the honeybee such as learning and memory. The authors tested the PER to odorants on bees after exposure to monoterpenoids in hives. Octopamine receptors, transient receptor potential-like (TRPL), and γ-aminobutyric acid channels are thought to play a critical role in the memory of food experience. Gene expression levels of Amoa1, Rdl, and trpl were evaluated in parallel in the bee brain because these genes code for the cellular targets of monoterpenoids and some pesticides and neural circuits of memory require their expression. The miticide impaired the PER to odors in the 3 wk following treatment. Short-term and long-term olfactory memories were improved months after introduction of the monoterpenoids into the beehives. Chronic exposure to the miticide had significant effects on Amoa1, Rdl, and trpl gene expressions and modified seasonal changes in the expression of these genes in the brain. The decrease of expression of these genes in winter could partly explain the improvement of memory. The present study has led to new insights into alternative treatments, especially on their effects on memory and expression of selected genes involved in this cognitive function.

TI  - The potential consequences of pollinator declines on the conservation of biodiversity and stability of food crop yields.
AU  - Cane, James H.
T2  - Conservation Biology
AB  - Following reports of dramatic declines in managed and feral honey bees from nearly every region of North America, scientists and resource managers from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada came together to review the quality of the evidence that honey bees as well as other pollinators are in long-term decline and to consider the potential consequences of these losses on the conservation of biodiversity and the stability of the yield of food crops. These experts in pollination ecology confirmed that the last 5 years of losses of honeybee colonies in North America leave us with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the last 50 years and that the management and protection of wild pollinators is an issue of paramount importance to our food supply system. Although there are conclusive data that indicate 1200 wild vertebrate pollinators may be at risk, data on the status of most invertebrate species that act as pollination agents is lacking. The recommendations from a working group of over 20 field scientists, presented here, have been endorsed by 14 conservation and sustainable agriculture organizations, research institutes, and professional societies, including the Society for Conservation Biology. Among the most critical priorities for future research and conservation of pollinator species are (1) increased attention to invertebrate systematics, monitoring, and reintroduction as part of critical habitat management and restoration plans; (2) multi-year assessments of the lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides, herbicides, and habitat fragmentation on wild pollinator populations in and near croplands; (3) inclusion of the monitoring of seed and fruit set and floral visitation rates in endangered plant management and recovery plans; (4) inclusion of habitat needs for critically-important pollinators in the critical habitat designations for endangered plants; (5) identification and protection of floral reserves near roost sites along the “nectar corridors” of threatened migratory pollinators; and (6) investment in the restoration and management of a diversity of pollinators and their habitats adjacent to croplands in order to stabilize or improve crop yields. The work group encourages increased education and training to ensure that both the lay public and resource managers understand that pollination is one of the most important ecological services provided to agriculture through the responsible management and protection of wildland habitats and their populations of pollen-vectoring animals and nectar-producing plants. Consecuencias Potenciales de la Disminucion de Polinizadores en la Conservacion de la Biodiversidad y la Estabilidad en la Produccion de Cosechas de Alimentos Resumen: Debido a los constantes reportes de disminuciones dramaticas de abejas productoras de miel tanto manejadas como silvestres en casi todas las regiones de Norteamerica, cientificos y manejadores de recursos de Estados Unidos, Mexico y Canada se reunieron para revisar la calidad de las evidencias de que las abejas, asi como otros polinizadores se encuentran en una disminucion a largo plazo y para considerer las consecuencias potenciales de estas perdidas en la conservacion de la biodiversidad y la estabilidad de las cosechas de alimentos. Estos expertos en ecologia de la polinizacion confirmaron que los ultimos cinco anos de perdidas de colonias de abejas en Norteamerica nos ubican con menos polinizadores manejados que en ningun otro momento en los ultimos 50 anos y que el manejo y proteccion de polinizadores silvestres es un aspecto de suma importancia para nuestro sistema de abastecimiento de alimentos. A pesar de que existen datos concluyentes que indican que 1200 polinizadores vertebrados silvestres podrian encontrarse en riesgo, se carece de datos sobre la situacion de la mayoria de las especies de invertebrados que actuan como polinizadores. Las recomendaciones de un grupo de trabajo de mas de 20 cientificos, presentadas aqui, han sido respaldadas por 14 organizaciones de conservacion y agricultura sustentable, institutos de investigacion y sociedades de profesionistas incluyendo la Sociedad para la Biologia de la Conservacion. Entre las prioridades mas criticas de investigacion y conservacion de especies de polinizadores se encuentran; 1) incrementar el enfoque en sistematica de invertebrados, monitoreo y reintroduccion como parte del manejo de habitat critico y planes de restauracion; 2) evaluaciones de varios anos de los efectos letales y subletales de pesticidas, herbicidas y la fragmentacion del habitat en las poblaciones silvestres de polinizadores dentro y alrededor de las 10 Pollinator Declines Allen-Wardell et al. Conservation Biology Volume 12, No. 1, February 1998 tierras de cosechas; 3) inclusion del monitoreo de semillas y frutas y las tasas de visita en los planes de manejo y recuperacion de plantas; 4) inclusion de las necesidades de habitat para polinizadores criticamente importates en las designaciones de habitat critico para plantas amenazadas; 5) identification y proteccion de reservas florales cerca de sitios de percha a lo largo de “corredores de nectar” de polinizadores migratorios amenazados; y 6) inversion en la investigacion y manejo de una diversidad de polinizadores y sus habitats adyacentes a sitios con cosechas para poder estabilizar e improvisar la produccion de las cosechas. El grupo de trabajo hace un llamado para estimular un incremento en educacion y entrenamiento para asegurar que tanto el publico como los manejadores de recursos entiendan que la polinizacion es uno de los servicios ecologicos mas importantes aportados a la agricultura a traves del manejo responsable y la proteccion de habitats silvestres y de sus poblaciones de animales vectores de polen y plantas productoras de nectar.

AB  - Despite widespread concern about declines in pollination services, little is known about the patterns of change in most pollinator assemblages. By studying bee and hoverfly assemblages in Britain and the Netherlands, we found evidence of declines (pre-versus post-1980) in local bee diversity in both countries; however, divergent trends were observed in hoverflies. Depending on the assemblage and location, pollinator declines were most frequent in habitat and flower specialists, in univoltine species, and/or in nonmigrants. In conjunction with this evidence, outcrossing plant species that are reliant on the declining pollinators have themselves declined relative to other plant species. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a causal connection between local extinctions of functionally linked plant and pollinator species.

TI  - Combined neonicotinoid pesticide and parasite stress alter honeybee queens’ physiology and survival
AU  - Dussaubat, Alban; Crauser, Claudia; Maisonnasse
T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - Honeybee colony survival strongly relies on the queen to overcome worker losses exposed to combined stressors like pesticides and parasites. Queen’s capacity to withstand these stressors is however very little known. The effects of the common neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid in a chronic and sublethal exposure together with the wide distributed parasite Nosema ceranae have therefore been investigated on queen’s physiology and survivorship in laboratory and field conditions. Early physiological changes were observed on queens, particularly the increase of enzyme activities (catalase [CAT] and glutathione-S-transferase [GST] in the heads) related to protective responses to xenobiotics and oxidative stress against pesticide and parasite alone or combined. Stressors also alter the activity of two other enzymes (carboxylesterase alpha [CaE α] and carboxylesterase para [CaE p] in the midguts) involved in metabolic and detoxification functions. Furthermore, single and combined effects of pesticide and parasite decrease survivorship of queens introduced into mating hives for three months. Because colony demographic regulation relies on queen’s fertility, the compromise of its physiology and life can seriously menace colony survival under pressure of combined stressors.

AU  - Aliouane, Abdessalam Kacimi El; Gary, Yassine; Hassani
T2  - Environmental toxicology and chemistry
AB  - Laboratory bioassays were conducted to evaluate on honeybee behavior the effects of sublethal doses of insecticides chronically administered orally or by contact. Emergent honeybees received a daily dose of insecticide ranging from one-fifth to one-five-hundredth of the median lethal dose (LD50) during 11 d. After exposure to fipronil (0.1 ng/bee and 0.01 ng/bee), acetamiprid (1 mug/bee and 0.1mug/bee) or thiamethoxam (1ng/bee and 0.1 ng/bee), behavioral functions of honeybees were tested on day 12. Fipronil, used at the dose of 0.1 ng/bee, induced mortality of all honeybees after one week of treatment. As a result of contact treatment at 0.01 ng/bee, honeybees spent significantly more time immobile in an open field apparatus and ingested significantly more water. In the olfactory conditioning paradigm, fipronil-treated honeybees failed to discriminate between a known and an unknown odorant. Thiamethoxam by contact induced either a significant decrease of olfactory memory 24 h after learning at 0.1 ng/bee or a significant impairment of learning performance with no effect on memory at 1 ng/bee. Responsiveness to antennal sucrose stimulation was significantly decreased for high sucrose concentrations in honeybees treated orally with thiamethoxam (1 ng/bee). The only significant effect of acetamiprid (administered orally, 0.1 mug/bee) was an increase in responsiveness to water. The neonicotinoids acetamiprid and thiamethoxam tested at the highest dose (one-tenth and one-fifth of their oral LD50 respectively) and fipronil at one-five-hundredth of LD50 have limited effects on the motor, sensory and cognitive functions of the honeybee. Our data on the intrinsic toxicity of the compounds after chronic exposure have to be taken into account for evaluation of risk to honeybees in field conditions.

AU  - Alaux, Morgane; McDonnell, Cédric; Folschweiller
T2  - Journal of invertebrate pathology
AB  - Nosema ceranae, a microsporidian parasite originally described in the Asian honey bee Apis cerana, has recently been found to be cross-infective and to also parasitize the European honey bee Apis mellifera. Since this discovery, many studies have attempted to characterize the impact of this parasite in A. mellifera honey bees. Nosema species can infect all colony members, workers, drones and queens, but the pathological effects of this microsporidium has been mainly investigated in workers, despite the prime importance of the queen, who monopolizes the reproduction and regulates the cohesion of the society via pheromones. We therefore analyzed the impact of N. ceranae on queen physiology. We found that infection by N. ceranae did not affect the fat body content (an indicator of energy stores) but did alter the vitellogenin titer (an indicator of fertility and longevity), the total antioxidant capacity and the queen mandibular pheromones, which surprisingly were all significantly increased in Nosema-infected queens. Thus, such physiological changes may impact queen health, leading to changes in pheromone production, that could explain Nosema-induced supersedure (queen replacement).

TI  - Effect of in-hive miticides on drone honey bee survival and sperm viability
AU  - Johnson, Lizette; Siegfried, Reed M.; Dahlgren
T2  - Journal of Apicultural Research
AB  - SummaryThe survival of a honey bee colony depends, in part, on the reproductive success of the queen, which in turn depends on the viability of sperm produced by drones with which the queen mates. Colony success also depends on management of the ectoparasitic bee mite, Varroa destructor, which has historically been achieved using miticides that may also impact honey bee health. Previous work has demonstrated that the exposure of drone honey bees to miticidal Checkmite+TM strips (coumaphos) can result in decreased sperm viability. In this study we applied a range of sublethal doses of six miticides (tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos, fenpyroximate, amitraz, thymol and oxalic acid) to 1–4 day old adult drones. We returned drones to their home colony and re-collected them two to three weeks later to assess sperm viability using SYBR14 and propidium iodide stains. Counts of live and dead sperm were automated using the EBImage library in the R statistical environment. Sperm viability was not affected by any of the si...

AU  - Chaimanee, Jay D.; Chen, Veeranan; Evans

AB  - Honey bee population declines are of global concern. Numerous factors appear to cause these declines including parasites, pathogens, malnutrition and pesticides. Residues of the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, widely used to combat Varroa mites and for crop protection in agriculture, respectively, have been detected in wax, pollen and comb samples. Here, we assess the effects of these compounds at different doses on the viability of sperm stored in the honey bee queens' spermatheca. Our results demonstrate that sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid (0.02ppm) decreased sperm viability by 50

TI  - Molecular effects of neonicotinoids in honey bees (apis mellifera)
AU  - Christen, Fabian; Fent, Verena; Mittner
T2  - Environmental science & technology
AB  - Neonicotinoids are implicated in the decline of bee populations. As agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling leading to neurotoxicity. Several behavioral studies showed the link between neonicotinoid exposure and adverse effects on foraging activity and reproduction. However, molecular effects underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we elucidated molecular effects at environmental realistic levels of three neonicotinoids and nicotine, and compared laboratory studies to field exposures with acetamiprid. We assessed transcriptional alterations of eight selected genes in caged honey bees exposed to different concentrations of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloporid, and thiamethoxam, as well as nicotine. We determined transcripts of several targets, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α 1 and α 2 subunit, the multifunctional gene vitellogenin, immune system genes apidaecin and defensin-1, stress-related gene catalase and two genes linked to memory formation, pka and creb. Vitellogenin showed a strong increase upon neonicotinoid exposures in the laboratory and field, while creb and pka transcripts were down-regulated. The induction of vitellogenin suggests adverse effects on foraging activity, whereas creb and pka down-regulation may be implicated in decreased long-term memory formation. Transcriptional alterations occurred at environmental concentrations and provide an explanation for the molecular basis of observed adverse effects of neonicotinoids to bees.

Several methods have been developed to control this pest. Optimization of control measures, and possibly successful eradication measures against this invasive coleopteran will contribute to contain the general problem of the decline of A. mellifera worldwide.

AU  - Martín-Hernández, Mariano; Sagastume, Raquel; Higes
T2  - PloS one
AB  - Intracellular parasites can alter the cellular machinery of host cells to create a safe haven for their survival. In this regard, microsporidia are obligate intracellular fungal parasites with extremely reduced genomes and hence, they are strongly dependent on their host for energy and resources. To date, there are few studies into host cell manipulation by microsporidia, most of which have focused on morphological aspects. The microsporidia Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae are worldwide parasites of honey bees, infecting their ventricular epithelial cells. In this work, quantitative gene expression and histology were studied to investigate how these two parasites manipulate their host’s cells at the molecular level. Both these microsporidia provoke infection-induced regulation of genes involved in apoptosis and the cell cycle. The up-regulation of buffy (which encodes a pro-survival protein) and BIRC5 (belonging to the Inhibitor Apoptosis protein family) was observed after infection, shedding light on the pathways that these pathogens use to inhibit host cell apoptosis. Curiously, different routes related to cell cycle were modified after infection by each microsporidia. In the case of N. apis, cyclin B1, dacapo and E2F2 were up-regulated, whereas only cyclin E was up-regulated by N. ceranae, in both cases promoting the G1/S phase transition. This is the first report describing molecular pathways related to parasite-host interactions that are probably intended to ensure the parasite’s survival within the cell.

TI  - An inert pesticide adjuvant synergizes viral pathogenicity and mortality in honey bee larvae.
AU  - Fine, Diana; Mullin, Julia D.; Cox-Foster
T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - Honey bees are highly valued for their pollination services in agricultural settings, and recent declines in managed populations have caused concern. Colony losses following a major pollination event in the United States, almond pollination, have been characterized by brood mortality with specific symptoms, followed by eventual colony loss weeks later. In this study, we demonstrate that these symptoms can be produced by chronically exposing brood to both an organosilicone surfactant adjuvant (OSS) commonly used on many agricultural crops including wine grapes, tree nuts and tree fruits and exogenous viral pathogens by simulating a horizontal transmission event. Observed synergistic mortality occurred during the larval-pupal molt. Using q-PCR techniques to measure gene expression and viral levels in larvae taken prior to observed mortality at metamorphosis, we found that exposure to OSS and exogenous virus resulted in significantly heightened Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV) titers and lower expression of a Toll 7-like-receptor associated with autophagic viral defense (Am18w). These results demonstrate that organosilicone spray adjuvants that are considered biologically inert potentiate viral pathogenicity in honey bee larvae, and guidelines for OSS use may be warranted.

AB  - Reports of honey bee population decline has spurred many national efforts to understand the extent of the problem and to identify causative or associated factors. However, our collective understanding of the factors has been hampered by a lack of joined up trans-national effort. Moreover, the impacts of beekeeper knowledge and beekeeping management practices have often been overlooked, despite honey bees being a managed pollinator. Here, we established a standardised active monitoring network for 5 798 apiaries over two consecutive years to quantify honey bee colony mortality across 17 European countries.

TI  - Characteristics of imidacloprid toxicity in two Apis mellifera subspecies
AU  - Suchail, David; Belzunces, Séverine; Guez
T2  - Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry
AB  - Imidacloprid (1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-N-nitroimidazolidin-2-ylideneamine) belongs to a new chemical family of chloronicotinyl compounds whose mode of action on the insect nervous system differs from that of traditional neurotoxic products. Imidacloprid, a strong systemic compound, is effective against several sucking and mining pests. The acute toxicity of contact and oral applications on two Apis mellifera subspecies, Apis mellifera mellifera and Apis mellifera caucasica, was investigated. In all toxicological studies, each dose included three cages of 20 individuals and each study was replicated three times. The dose-mortality relation revealed some unusual characteristics. At low imidacloprid concentrations, a biphasic mortality appeared, particularly with the contact exposure route. At moderate doses, mortality profiles at 24 and 48 h were different only after oral application. Response kinetics showed that mortality was delayed at the higher doses of imidacloprid. After oral intoxication, the LD50 values of imidacloprid at 24 and 48 h were about 5 ng/bee for both A. m. mellifera and A. m. caucasica. After contact application, the LD50 values at 24 and 48 h were approximately 24 ng/bee for A. m. mellifera and 14 ng/bee for A. m. caucasica. Imidacloprid ranks among the more potent contact insecticides in this important pollinator species.

TI  - Towards an integrated environmental risk assessment of multiple stressors on bees: review of research projects in Europe, knowledge gaps and recommendations
T2  - EFSA Journal
AB  - This report reviews recent work on bee health carried out by EFSA, Member States (MSs) and the European Commission (EC).It identifies data and knowledge gaps and provides research recommendations that may facilitate the transition towards an integrated environmental risk assessment of multiple stressors on bees.The report was produced by the EFSA Bee Task Force (TF), involved representatives from six different Scientific Units, and was coordinated by the Scientific Committee and Emerging Risks Unit (SCER).The TF consulted experts from MSs and the Bee Interservice Group of the EC.Additional scientific exchanges with experts were promoted by SCER through the organisation of a scientific colloquium on bee health in May 2013.The review identified a total of 220 research projects on bee health at EU level (EFSA, 19; MSs, 181; EC, 20), and 33 additional projects from other international organisations dealing with general aspects, non-research-focused, of bee issues.A quantitative assessment of the retrieved projects revealed that research projects on multiple stressors on bees and projects on bees other than honeybees were missing, especially with regard to monitoring and testing.EFSA projects were predominantly in the area of risk assessments of pesticides on bees.Research projects on in-hive treatments and bee exposure to chemicals funded at the EC level were scarce, as were those focusing on protection goals, bee diversity and pollination services at the MS level.The qualitative assessment of the retrieved projects revealed knowledge gaps at each step of the risk assessment, which led to several recommendations for future scientific work at EFSA and research to be undertaken in the framework of Horizon 2020.Additional recommendations are given for research coordination, planning and knowledge sharing with MSs and the EC.At EFSA level, further communication, internal collaborations and training on bee health are suggested.

TI  - Reconciling laboratory and field assessments of neonicotinoid toxicity to honeybees.
AU  - Henry, Nicolas; Aupinel, Mickaël; Cerrutti
T2  - Proceedings. Biological sciences
AB  - European governments have banned the use of three common neonicotinoid pesticides due to insufficiently identified risks to bees. This policy decision is controversial given the absence of clear consistency between toxicity assessments of those substances in the laboratory and in the field. Although laboratory trials report deleterious effects in honeybees at trace levels, field surveys reveal no decrease in the performance of honeybee colonies in the vicinity of treated fields. Here we provide the missing link, showing that individual honeybees near thiamethoxam-treated fields do indeed disappear at a faster rate, but the impact of this is buffered by the colonies’ demographic regulation response. Although we could ascertain the exposure pathway of thiamethoxam residues from treated flowers to honeybee dietary nectar, we uncovered an unexpected pervasive co-occurrence of similar concentrations of imidacloprid, another neonicotinoid normally restricted to non-entomophilous crops in the study country. Thus, its origin and transfer pathways through the succession of annual crops need be elucidated to conveniently appraise the risks of combined neonicotinoid exposures. This study reconciles the conflicting laboratory and field toxicity assessments of neonicotinoids on honeybees and further highlights the difficulty in actually detecting non-intentional effects on the field through conventional risk assessment methods.

AU  - Kairo, Bertille; Tchamitchian, Guillaume; Provost
T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - A species that requires sexual reproduction but cannot reproduce is doomed to extinction. The important increasing loss of species emphasizes the ecological significance of elucidating the effects of environmental stressors, such as pesticides, on reproduction. Despite its special reproductive behavior, the honey bee was selected as a relevant and integrative environmental model because of its constant and diverse exposure to many stressors due to foraging activity. The widely used insecticide Fipronil, the use of which is controversial because of its adverse effects on honey bees, was chosen to expose captive drones in hives via syrup contaminated at 0.1 μg/L and gathered by foragers. Such environmental exposure led to decreased spermatozoa concentration and sperm viability coupled with an increased sperm metabolic rate, resulting in drone fertility impairment. Subsequently, unexposed queens inseminated with such sperm exhibited fewer spermatozoa with lower viability in their spermatheca, leaving no doubt about the detrimental consequences for the reproductive potential of queens, which are key for colony sustainability. These findings suggest that pesticides could contribute to declining honey bee populations through fertility impairment, as exemplified by Fipronil. More broadly, reproductive disorders should be taken into consideration when investigating the decline of other species.

AB  - Twenty‐two honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies were placed in four different cornfield areas in order to study the potential in situ effects of seed‐coated systemic neonicotinoid pesticides used in cornfields (Zea mays spp) on honeybee health. Two apiaries were located in two independent neonicotinoid‐treated cornfield areas and two others in two independent untreated cornfield areas used as controls. These experimental hives were extensively monitored for their performance and health traits over a period of one year. Trapped pollen was collected and microscopically identified to define the visited flowers and the amount of corn pollen collected by bees. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was performed to detect pesticide residues in honeybee foragers and trapped pollen. Honeybee colonies located in neonicotinoid‐treated cornfields expressed significantly higher varroa mite loads than those in untreated cornfields. However, brood production and colony weight were less disturbed by the treatment factor. Sublethal doses of neonicotinoids were detected in the trapped corn pollen and none in bee foragers. Overall, our results show that forager bees collected 20
