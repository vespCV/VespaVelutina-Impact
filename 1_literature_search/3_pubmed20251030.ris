AB  - The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina subs. nigrithorax Buysson, 1905, originally from Southeast Asia, has become an invasive species in Europe since  its introduction in France around 2004. Its rapid proliferation and voracious  predatory behavior pose a significant threat to native insects, particularly  honeybees and other pollinators, impacting agricultural production, biodiversity,  and human safety. Eradication in Europe seems now impossible, and the control  efforts are hindered by the lack of standardized application protocols, including  for insecticide use, leading to potential indiscriminate pesticide application  and, consequently, environmental damages. Our study evaluated the acute contact  toxicity on V. v. nigrithorax workers of four commercially available formulations  containing acetamiprid, cypermethrin, a mix of natural pyrethrins, and Spinosad  as active ingredients. These tests were performed in laboratory conditions,  offering novel data for the chemical control of this invasive species. Our  results suggest acetamiprid and spinosad as promising candidates for the  yellow-legged hornet control. Further research is needed to validate their  efficacy under field conditions and assess ecological impacts of these pesticides  on non-target organisms. Integrated pest management strategies should prioritize  insecticides with low non-target toxicity and minimal environmental persistence  to mitigate resistance development and ensure effective pest control.  Comprehensive assessments considering multiple factors beyond mortality are  essential for informing sustainable pest control strategies.

AB  - This study investigates specimens of the Asian yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax du Buysson, 1905) originating from the first colony detected  in Hungary. Phylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c  subunit 1 gene confirms their European origin and definitely identifies them as  V. velutina. The detection in Hungary represented the species' farthest  documented occurrence from its established European distribution at that time,  highlighting its significant dispersal potential. Given the high density of bee  populations in the region, particular attention should be paid to control efforts  during the early stages of colonization.

AB  - Most terrestrial invertebrates are in considerable decline, and the range expansion of the invasive hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, poses an additional  threat. Although now found in much of western Europe, the full extent of the  hornet's predatory activity remains unexplored. While impacts on honey bees are  well-documented, evidence of a wider dietary spectrum is emerging, indicating  potentially broad ecological ramifications. Here, we conduct the first  large-scale study of the diet of V. velutina, utilising deep sequencing to  characterise the larval gut contents of over 1500 samples from Jersey, France,  Spain, and the UK. Our results indicate that V. velutina is a highly flexible  predator, enabling its continued range expansion capacity. Analyses detected 1449  taxa, with greater prey richness in samples from southern latitudes, and  considerable spatiotemporal variation in dietary composition. Hymenoptera,  Diptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Araneae were the most frequently  occurring orders predated, each characterised by high taxonomic diversity. The  honey bee Apis mellifera was the most abundant species, being found in all  sampled nests and showing greater relative read numbers with increasing apiary  density and proximity, supporting concerns for the impact of V. velutina on  apiculture. Notably, 43 of the 50 most commonly predated invertebrates were also  flower visitors, including 4 common bumblebee species, indicating potentially  substantial risks to wild pollinators. These data provide wide and deep evidence  to support risk evaluation of this species and its potential environmental impact  as it spreads across Europe.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological control in integrated pest management (IPM) often overlooked avian predators until the emergence of the ecosystem services  approach. Birds are now recognized as key regulators of pest populations in  agroforestry landscapes due to their high mobility. The invasive yellow-legged  hornet, introduced into Europe in 2004, threatens agriculture, beekeeping and  native pollinators. We aimed to determine whether European honey buzzard attacks  on yellow-legged hornet nests reduce the densities of individuals (workers) in  summer and full-grown colonies in November around the raptor's nests in  southwestern Europe. RESULTS: We analyzed honey-buzzard foraging patterns of 11  individuals during breeding using trail cameras and GPS emitters to locate  attacked hornet nests. The average mode distance from raptor nests to the  attacked hornet nests was 1234.7 m, with 89.3% of attacked nests destroyed. We  assessed the change in the abundance of hornet workers and in the density of  full-grown nests over distance in the vicinity of 17 honey-buzzard nests and 10  control points, finding a significant decline of -0.000116 workers h(-1) m(-1)  within 1000 m of a raptor nest. This impact intensified as the breeding season  progressed. However, no significant effect on the density of full-grown hornet  nests was observed. CONCLUSION: These results are of interest for the management  of the exotic hornet, at least on the abundance of workers and at a small scale  in the proximity of honey-buzzard nests. These raptors should be considered  allies in the fight against hornet populations and included in IPM programmes as  a native controller of the pest. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Apiaries in Galicia, northwestern Spain, are currently facing the invasive alien species Vespa velutina, which is well established in the region. The pressure on  honey bee colonies is high, resulting in both economic and ecological losses.  Honey bee colonies also face the challenge of viruses, which are becoming  increasingly diverse. In recent years, honey bee viruses have been spreading  across taxonomic groups beyond Apoidea, infecting the Vespoidea superfamily. This  cross-species spillover has raised concerns in the scientific community due to  the potential risk of viruses spreading in ecosystems. Currently, there is a lack  of knowledge on this topic, and further research is needed to address this issue.  This study employed qPCR and sequencing to investigate the prevalence, loads, and  presence of replicative forms of important honey bee viruses in V. velutina  individuals collected from 11 apiaries in Galicia. All V. velutina individuals  tested positive for DWV, BQCV, AKI complex (ABPV, KBV, and IAPV), or LSV but not  for CBPV. DWV showed the highest prevalence (97.0 %) and loads, with both DWV-A  (67.4 %) and DWV-B (32.6 %) being detected. The AKI complex (46.3 %) and LSV  (43.3 %) were also common, whereas BQCV (11.9 %) was rarer. LSV is detected for  the first time in V. velutina. LSV-2 was the dominant strain (82.1 %), and two  less frequent (17.9 %) unknown strains were also detected. All 44 screened V.  velutina samples carried the replicative form of DWV, and six of these also  carried the replicative form of LSV, raising for the first time the possibility  of co-infection in the hornet. The detection of honey bee viruses in V. velutina,  and the ability of these viruses to spread to other species, may indicate a  potential risk of spillover in the apiaries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) is a predatory species native to South-East Asia. The hornet is invasive in Europe, spreading to  several countries and becoming a pest for Apis mellifera due to its behaviour of  preying in front of apiaries. The aim of this study was (i) to investigate the  presence of honey bee pathogens within the developmental stages of V. velutina  after neutralizing a nest in Bologna province (Emilia-Romagna, Italy) and (ii) to  analyze the mitochondrial DNA to determine if the population derived from the  population initially introduced in Europe. RESULTS: The results indicated that  deformed wing virus (82.76%) and Nosema ceranae (67.28%) were the most prevalent  pathogens. Deformed wing virus, N. ceranae and sacbrood virus were found in all  investigated stages, while chronic bee paralysis virus and Kashmir bee virus were  exclusively found in foraging adults. All detected viruses were found to be  replicative, highlighting active infection in the hosts. The mtDNA analysis  demonstrated that the origin derived from the invasive population arrived in  France. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the importance of further research to  understand the effect of interspecific transmission, especially concerning the  potential role of these pathogens as a biocontrol for the invasive V. velutina  nigrithorax. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The invasion of Asian yellow-legged hornets (Vespa velutina) has significantly affected Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) and apiculture in  Europe. However, the range dynamics of this hornet and its range overlap with the  bees under future change scenarios have not yet been clarified. Using land-use,  climate, and topographical datasets, we projected the range dynamics of this  hornet and Western honey bees in Europe and the future overlap of their ranges.  RESULTS: We found that climatic factors had stronger effects on the potential  ranges of the hornets compared with land-use and topographical factors. A  considerable range expansion of this hornet was predicted, and an increase in the  overlap between this pest and the bees was primarily caused by future decreases  in temperature seasonality. Additionally, we detected future range expansions of  the hornet in the UK and France; future range overlap between this pest and  Western honey bees in the UK, Ireland, Portugal, and France; and future overlap  between the ranges of this pest and bees but not under recent conditions was  mainly projected in Germany, Denmark, and the UK. CONCLUSION: Mitigating future  climate change might effectively control the proliferation of the hornets and  their effects on the bees. Strategies for preventing the invasion of this pest  and developing European apiculture should be developed and implemented in these  regions where future range overlap between them was projected. Given that  climate-change scenarios may result in uncertainty in our projections, further  investigation is needed to clarify future range changes of our target species. ©  2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Germany, honeybees (Apis mellifera) and various Vespula species (wasps) are primarily relevant for hypersensitivity reactions to stings. Hornets  (Vespa crabro), bumblebees, paper wasps (Polistes) and yellowjackets  (Dolichovespula) less frequently cause sting reactions. OBJECTIVE: What effects  do intensive agricultural utilization and climate change have on the living  conditions and occurrence of Hymenoptera and what consequences do they have for  the diagnostics and treatment of hypersensitivity reactions to Hymenoptera  stings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was carried out. RESULTS:  Honeybees and wild bees are endangered due to introduced diseases, invasive  species and pesticides. The aim of widespread beekeeping activity is to protect  honeybees, which is why no reduction in stings is to be expected despite  increased bee mortality. In Germany, there is evidence of the spread of  thermophilic Polistes species (paper wasps) from south to north and the  immigration of Vespa velutina nigrithorax (Asian hornet). It is unlikely that  these species will lead to a significant increase in sting reactions. Nests of  the red fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), which was originally common in South  America, were first detected in Sicily in 2022. Red fire ants are aggressive  insects with a high potential for adverse sting reactions. CONCLUSION: Invasive  insects must be considered as a trigger in the anamnesis and diagnostics.  Diagnostics are only available for the detection of Polistes sensitization.  Therapeutic allergens can be obtained from other European countries for venom  immunotherapy of a Polistes allergy. Due to cross-reactivity, diagnostic and  therapeutic allergens from Vespula spp. are used for the diagnosis and treatment  of suspected allergies to the Asian hornet.

AB  - Biological invasions have ecological impacts worldwide with potential massive economic costs. Among other ecosystem services such as nitrogen cycle, carbon  sequestration and primary production, invasive alien species are particularly  known to impact pollination. By predating honey bees (Apis mellifera), the  invasive Yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) increases the  mortality risk of European bee colonies; however, little is known about its  economic costs. We developed an analytic process combining large-scale field  data, niche modelling techniques and agent-based models to spatially assess the  ecological and economic impacts of the Yellow-legged hornet on honey bees and  beekeeping in France. In particular, we estimated (i) the hornet-related risk of  bee colony mortality, (ii) the economic cost of colony loss for beekeepers and  (iii) the economic impact of livestock replacement compared to honey revenues at  regional and national scales. We estimated an overall density of 1.08 hornet  nest/km(2) in France, based on the field record of 1260 nests over a searched  area of 28,348 km(2). However, this predator density was heterogeneously spread  out across the country as well as the distribution of managed honey bee colonies.  Overall, this hornet-related risk of bee colony mortality could reach up to  29.2 % of the beekeepers' livestock at national scale each year in high predation  scenario. This national cost could reach as much as € 30.8 million per year due  to colony loss, which represents for beekeepers an economic impact of livestock  replacement of 26.6 % of honey revenues. Our results suggest non-negligible  ecological and economic impacts of the invasive Yellow-legged hornet on honey  bees and beekeeping activities. Moreover, this study meets the urgent need for  more numerous and accurate economic estimations, necessary to calculate the  impact of biological invasions on biodiversity and human goods, with a view to  enhance policies of biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The Yellow-legged Hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) (YLH) is an invasive insect that arrived in Europe in 2004 and is now spread across nine countries. It is a  threat to the native entomofauna and harmful to beekeeping and agriculture, as it  is a ravenous predator of the European Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) and other  pollinating species. Its expansion has been unstoppable and all resources are  needed to fight against it, including native vertebrate predators. Among these,  the European Bee-eater (Merops apiaster) (EBE) is a potential one, but little is  known about its predation on YLH. In a study carried out in Portugal, remains of  YHL were detected in EBE nesting sites, which, to the best of our knowledge, is  the first such report. This means that this bird could be one more agent in the  biological control of this pest (although research on predation intensity is  still needed), in conjunction with other natural predators and other strategies.  In the Iberian Peninsula, both species are allopatric in vast regions, so the  role of EBE may be more limited. However, in the rest of Europe, at a country or  continent scale, the scenario may be different and sympatry may occur to a  greater extent.

AB  - The Asian hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), is an invasive hornet that was accidentally introduced into Europe in 2004. It mainly  preys on other invertebrates and arthropod species, and often targets honey bee  (Apis mellifera) colonies. The introduction of these hornets may damage  indigenous fauna and apiculture. Knowledge of V. velutina prey preference and the  species composition of their diet is relatively limited. In this study, we  assessed methodologies for the molecular identification of prey using dissected  larvae from destroyed nests. Ten larval samples were taken from five nests in  areas where the hornets had not yet established: two from the Channel Islands and  three in the mainland UK. DNA was extracted from the gut contents and sequenced  and analysed by metabarcoding with Oxford Nanopore Technologies' Flongle and  MinION devices. Numerous taxa were detected in each larval sample with the  species composition varying by individual and by nest. Between 15 and 26 species  were found per nest, with wasps (Vespula spp.), spiders, honey bees and blow  flies being the most abundant taxa. These results demonstrate that metabarcoding  larval gut contents can be used to study the Asian hornet diet and give a first  snapshot of the prey items captured by V. v. nigrithorax in the UK. This method  could be used for future large-scale testing of the gut contents of hornet nests,  in order to provide a greater insight into the foraging behaviour of this  predator across Europe and elsewhere.

AB  - From its introduction in Europe, Vespa velutina nigrithorax has become an invasive species, since it is a predator of native fruits and insects, most of  the latter being honeybees. Despite the knowledge on the life cycle of this  hornet, Asian hornet behaviour is not well understood, since in vivo studies on  this species are quite difficult to perform. In this work, an observational study  of the behaviour of this invasive species in captivity has been carried out. Two  secondary and one embryo nests were caught and kept under controlled  environmental conditions, up to 13 weeks for the secondary nest and 6 weeks for  the embryo nest. Captivity adaptation, defence against perturbations, evolution  of the colony and overwintering were the different behaviours studied. The study  has shown the importance of avoiding disturbances to the nest from the beginning  of the experiments, since they tend to destroy the colony. The aggressive  behaviour observed in the embryo nest was lower than in the secondary nests.  Results of this research will allow obtaining additional information on this  species, which is crucial to develop effective control methods.

AB  - The increase in invasive alien species is a concern for the environment. The establishment of some of these species may be changing the balance between  pathogenicity and host factors, which could alter the defense strategies of  native host species. Vespid species are among the most successful invasive  animals, such as the genera Vespa, Vespula and Polistes. Bee viruses have been  extensively studied as an important cause of honey bee population losses.  However, knowledge about the transmission of honey bee viruses in Vespids is a  relevant and under-researched aspect. The role of some mites such as Varroa in  the transmission of honey bee viruses is clearer than in the case of Vespidae.  This type of transmission by vectors has not yet been clarified in Vespidae, with  interspecific relationships being the main hypotheses accepted for the  transmission of bee viruses. A majority of studies describe the presence of  viruses or their replicability, but aspects such as the symptomatology in Vespids  or the ability to infect other hosts from Vespids are scarcely discussed.  Highlighting the case of Vespa velutina as an invader, which is causing huge  losses in European beekeeping, is of special interest. The pressure caused by V.  velutina leads to weakened hives that become susceptible to pathogens. Gathering  this information is necessary to promote further research on the spread of bee  viruses in ecosystems invaded by invasive species of Vespids, as well as to  prevent the decline of bee populations due to bee viruses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vespa velutina has become a species of concern in invaded regions of Europe and Asia, due to its impacts on biodiversity, apiculture and society. This  hornet, a ferocious hunter of pollinating insects, poses a serious threat to  biodiversity and pollination services. Despite ongoing efforts, its extermination  in continental Europe is hampered by a lack of effective control methods, thus  effective mitigation measures are primary concerns. The aims of this work were:  (i) to study the effects of V. velutina predating on honey bee colonies, and (ii)  to assess the effectiveness of electric harps in reducing hunting pressure and  predation. We assessed the predation pressure and compared honey bee colony  performance, body weight of workers, and winter survivorship for protected versus  unprotected colonies in 36 experimental hives across three apiaries. RESULTS:  Electric harps protected honey bees by reducing predation pressure and therefore  mitigating foraging paralysis. Consequently, foraging activity, pollen income,  brood production and worker body weight were higher in protected colonies which  in turn showed greater winter survivorship than those that were unprotected,  especially at sites with intermediate to high levels of predation. CONCLUSION:  The predation of V. velutina affects foraging activity, breeding, body weight and  colony survivorship of Apis mellifera. Electric harps contribute significantly to  mitigate the impact of this invasive hornet on apiaries; however, they should be  deployed in tandem with additional measures to preserve honey bee colony stocks,  such as facilitating access to food sources for colonies during the periods of  highest predation pressure. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Vespa velutina accidentally arrived in Europe (France) in 2004, and rapidly expanded throughout the entire country. Its presence in mainland Portugal was  first noticed in 2011. Being an invasive species with no natural predators in the  region to control it, it has caused enormous environmental and economic damage,  particularly on Apis mellifera (honeybee) colonies. Although there is already  some research on this species' biology, little is known about its adaption to  European ecological conditions, specifically in terms of nest building. This type  of hornet builds a primary nest in the spring to start a colony. During the  summer, they build a secondary nest to develop the main colony. These secondary  nests are ovoid-shaped and range in size from 18.7 cm to 45.0 cm in diameter and  from 19.2 cm to 65.0 cm in length, attaining their highest development in late  summer. The external appearance of these nests is characterized by alternating  stripes that are beige and brown in color. The main objective of this study is to  identify the composition and the origin of the materials that are used by Vespa  velutina nigrithorax to build the outer envelope of these secondary nests. This  information could be very interesting and will not only increase our knowledge on  the biology of the species in regions far from its original area, but will also  be relevant for the future implementation of new policies to control this  invasive species by means biological control. Several samples were taken from  each nest and were observed under different optical magnifying devices. In the  second stage, their chemical composition was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD)  and scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS). It was noticed that almost all of the  materials used in the nests' construction were lignocellulose from woody  materials from both softwood (gymnosperm) and hardwood (angiosperm) forest  species as well from leaves and small particles of agricultural origin (grasses).  The beige strips were formed almost exclusively from woody softwood cells, while  the brown strips were composed of hardwood cells, leaf tissues, and grasses.  Chemically, it was noticed that this material mainly consisted of cellulose, with  more than 99% being composed of C and O and very little mineral material from  elements such as Na, Al, Si, K, and Ca. The achieved results allow us to state  that in the construction of these secondary nests, these hornets only used  organic materials that are then probably agglomerated through their mouths.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The accuracy of predictions of invasive species ranges is dependent on niche similarity between invasive and native populations and on our ability to  identify the niche characteristics. With this work we aimed to compare the niche  dynamics of two genetically related invasive populations of Vespa velutina (an  effective predator of honeybees and wild pollinators), in two distinct climatic  regions, one in central Europe and another one in the north-western Iberian  Peninsula, and hence to identify uninvaded regions susceptible to invasion.  METHODS: Niche dynamics and shifts of V. velutina were assessed by comparing the  environmental niches of the native and of the two invasive populations, using  climatic, topographic and land use variables. We also ran reciprocal distribution  models using different algorithms and records from both native and invasive  ranges to compare model predictions and estimate which regions are at a greater  risk of being invaded. RESULTS: An apparent niche shift was detected in the  population of the NW of Iberian Peninsula, where the species is living under  environmental conditions different from the native niche. In central Europe,  large suitable areas remain unoccupied. The fact that both invasive populations  are well established, despite occupying environmentally distinct regions  indicates that V. velutina has a high ability to successfully invade different  environmental envelopes from those existing in its native range. For example, in  north-western Iberian Peninsula the species is now thriving out of its native  niche limits. Moreover, the large extent of still unoccupied environmental space  with similar conditions to those used by the species in its native range suggests  that there is still a large area of central and eastern Europe that can be  potentially invaded by the species.

AB  - Vespa velutina is an invasive species that is currently the main concern for beekeeping in some areas of northern Spain. The hornet hunts honeybees to feed  its larvae, stressing and weakening the honeybee colonies. To avoid losses of  honeybee colonies, it is essential to investigate the pressure that is exerted by  the yellow-legged hornet on apiaries and its consequences. In the present study,  hives were monitored in an apiary that was situated in a high-pressure area of V.  velutina during the years 2020 and 2021. The monitoring of environmental  conditions of the apiary, the internal conditions of the colonies, and a hunting  camera were used to relate the presence of hornets in front of the hives to the  weather conditions in the apiary and the consequences caused on the colonies. The  relationships between weather conditions and the hornet's activity showed two  types of hornet behavior. In the months of July and August, the maximum number of  hornets appeared in non-central hours of the day. Meanwhile, in the months of  September and October, the highest pressure in the apiary occurred in the central  hours of the day, coinciding with temperatures between 15 °C and 25 °C and a  relative humidity that was higher than 60%. The honeybee colony with the highest  thermoregulatory capacity was the strongest and it was the key factor for the  colony survival even when the hornet pressure was high too. Therefore,  strengthening the hives and improving beehive health status is essential to avoid  colonies decline.

AB  - Invasion of alien species facilitated by climate change and human assistant is one of global threats that cause irreversible damages on the local flora and  fauna. One of these issued species, Vespa velutina nigrithorax du Buysson, 1905  (Hymenoptera:Vespidae), is a significant threat to entomofauna, including  honeybees, in the introduced regions. This wasp is still expanding its habitats,  prioritizing the development of a reliable species distribution model based on  recently updated occurrence data. Therefore, the aim of this study was to  evaluate the potential areas that are climatically exposed to V. v. nigrithorax  invasion globally and in South Korea, where the wasp has caused severe damage to  local ecosystems and apiculture after its recent introduction. We developed a new  global scale ensemble model based on CLIMEX and Maxent models and applied it to  South Korea using field survey data. As a result, risky areas were predicted to  be temperate and subtropical climate regions, including the eastern USA, western  Europe, Far East Asia, and small areas in South America and Australia. In  particular, South Korea has a high potential risk throughout the country. We  expect that this study would provide fundamental data for monitoring the  environmental risks caused by V. v. nigrithorax using advanced species  distribution modeling.

AB  - The introduction of invasive species is considered one of the major threats to the biodiversity conservation worldwide. In recent years, an Asian invasive  species of wasp has set off alarms in Europe and elsewhere in the world, Vespa  velutina. The Asian wasp was accidentally introduced in France around 2004 and  shortly thereafter it was able to colonise practically all of Europe, including  the Iberian Peninsula. The ecological and economic implications of V. velutina  invasion and its high colonisation ability have triggered widespread trapping  campaigns, usually supported by beekeepers and local governments, with the aim of  diminishing its population and its negative impacts. Among the most used control  methods are the capture traps, which use a sugary attractant to catch the  invasive wasps. However, the species-specific selectivity and efficiency of these  traps has been little studied. In this paper, we have analysed the specific  identity of the unintentionally trapped insect species from northern Spain  (covering one-year period), as well as we have assessed the provided ecosystem  services by them. A total of 74 non-target taxa of insects were caught by the V.  velutina studied traps, most of them correspond to the orders Diptera,  Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, the dipterans being the most abundant group.  Surprisingly, the most abundant trapped species was the invasive fly, Drosophila  suzukii that represented the 36.07% of the total catches. Furthermore, we  reported the first record of ectoparasitic mites of the genus Varroa on V.  velutina, constituting a newly recorded symbiotic association. Hopefully, the  provided information helps to develop new protocols and management tools to  control this invasive species in the Iberian Peninsula and other temperate areas  of western Europe and the Mediterranean basin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, is an invasive alien species (IAS) which was accidentally introduced in Europe from Asia. This  social insect preys primarily on honeybees but also on other pollinators and  insects. Consequently, the establishment of this pest has a negative impact on  biodiversity, pollination and economy. There is no clear coordination and  uniformed methods for eradication measures between countries. Here we present the  first field study of the strategy of eradication of the pest species V. velutina  that has been conducted in the westernmost Mediterranean archipelago. RESULTS: We  investigated the combination of different eradication methods, such as trapping;  the use of the citizen science data for detection of presence, the active search  of nests and the removal of nests using mechanical methods. The progression of  the number of secondary nests found was 1 (2015), 9 (2016) and 20 (2017), with  zero during 2018, 2019 and 2020, and just one embryo nest in 2018. More than half  of the nests (58%) were detected thanks to citizen science data. The people sent  us adult detections, and we started the triangulation method to find the nests.  The last hornet found in the traps was in June 2018. CONCLUSION: Early detections  of the IAS are crucial to minimise their effects, and citizen science may offer  an important source of information to determine the presence and distribution of  V. velutina. The findings we present here indicate successful management for this  globally significant pest and could contribute to advance the 'science of  eradication'. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The recent introduction of the Asian yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, into Europe has raised concern regarding the threat to honeybees and the competition  with the European hornet, Vespa crabro. The aim of this study was to investigated  essential (Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) elements in these two  species. Element concentrations were determined in the whole body and separately  in the head, thorax and abdomen using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The  changes in essential element concentration and speciation during metamorphosis  were also studied using size exclusion chromatography followed by AAS and  proteomic analysis. In both species, the essential elements were more  concentrated in the abdomen due to the presence of fat bodies. Magnesium, Fe and  Zn concentrations were significantly higher in V. crabro than in V. velutina and  could have been related to the higher aerobic energy demand of the former species  required to sustain foraging flight. Low concentrations of Cd and Pb were  indicative of low environmental exposure. The concentration and speciation of  essential elements, particularly Fe, varied among the developmental stages,  indicating a modification of ligand preferences during metamorphosis. Overall,  the results in the present study provide a better understanding of the hornet  metal metabolism and a foundation for additional studies.

AB  - The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax (Hymenoptera: Vespidae, Lepeletier 1836), is native to Southeast Asia and has been unintentionally  introduced in France. The species is spreading in many areas of the world. The  European Union has classified V. velutina as a species of concern because the  hornet significantly affects beekeeping activities, mostly by preying honeybees  (Apis mellifera) at beehive entrances. No current control method is  simultaneously eco-friendly and effective. Here, we aimed to develop a greener  technique for destroying V. velutina nests, inspired by a defense behavior used  by the eastern honeybee (Apis cerana), the "heat ball". In the laboratory, we  tested how V. velutina of different sexes, castes, and developmental stages  responded to different heat exposure systems employing a range of temperature  levels. Overall, the time of death decreased as temperature increased. Hornets  died faster when the temperature was gradually increased than when it was  instantaneously increased; larvae seemed to be more thermally tolerant. The most  promising and potential technique for quickly destroying hornet nests may be  steam injection, as the humid airflow system killed all hornets within 13  seconds, and therefore could be a good candidate for a green nest control method.

AB  - Transmission of honey bee viruses to other insects, and vice versa, has previously been reported and the true ecological importance of this phenomenon is  still being realized. Members of the family Vespidae interact with honey bees via  predation or through the robbing of brood or honey from colonies, and these  activities could result in virus transfer. In this study we screened Vespa  velutina and Vespa crabro collected from Europe and China and also honey bees and  Vespula vulgaris from the UK for Moku virus (MV), an Iflavirus first discovered  in the predatory social wasp Vespula pensylvanica in Hawaii. MV was found in 71%  of Vespulavulgaris screened and was also detected in UK Vespa crabro. Only seven  percent of Vespa velutina individuals screened were MV-positive and these were  exclusively samples from Jersey. Of 69 honey bee colonies screened, 43% tested  positive for MV. MV replication was confirmed in Apis mellifera and Vespidae  species, being most frequently detected in Vespulavulgaris. MV sequences from the  UK were most similar to MV from Vespulapensylvanica compared to MV from Vespa  velutina in Belgium. The implications of the transfer of viruses between the  Vespidae and honey bees are discussed.

AB  - Vespa velutina nigrithorax is an invasive alien organism that has raised concerns in all beekeeping communities of invaded countries including the Republic of  Korea, European countries and Japan. Known also as the yellow-legged hornet (or  the 'Asian hornet'), it is native to northern India, eastern Nepal, Bhutan and  the People's Republic of China. Given its climatic and biological characteristics  and the effects of climate change, some coastal areas of North America,  Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are also susceptible to  invasion. Vespa velutina nigrithorax notably affects managed honey-bee colonies  by predation on foragers and causing a reduction in the collection of food  resources. Being a generalist predator, the yellow-legged hornet also preys on  other managed and wild pollinators, and therefore its impacts are not limited to  the beekeeping sector but also represent a biodiversity concern. The purpose of  this paper is to provide an assessment of V. v. nigrithorax against the four  criteria established in Chapter 1.2. of the World Organisation for Animal Health  (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code for the inclusion of a disease, infection or  infestation in the OIE list. The work was requested by the OIE Scientific  Commission for Animal Diseases and presented to this Commission and to the OIE  Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission in September 2017. Owing to the  lack of effective measures to prevent its spread, the fact that its legal  situation in some countries is under the mandate of environmental authorities  rather than Veterinary Services, and because it is not considered a disease or  parasite, V. v. nigrithorax is not currently being proposed for inclusion in the  OIE list. At the end of the text, the statements from the two commissions are  included and discussed.

AB  - Vespa velutina is an invasive hornet species that is colonising Europe, generating considerable impacts on honeybees, beekeeping and biodiversity.  Control and early warning strategies for this species are mainly based on  monitoring plans and procedures of nest detection and destruction. Technological  tools (harmonic radar, radio-telemetry) have been developed to increase the  probabilities of nest detection in new outbreaks. Since hornets are able to  regulate nest temperature, thermography may represent an additional technique  that may be used, both alone or in support to other techniques. In this study,  the viability of thermal imaging in detecting nests of V. velutina was evaluated  in controlled conditions. The influence of different environmental and operative  variables (time of the day, presence/absence of leaves covering the nest,  distance between the nest and the operator) were tested on three nests detected  during August 2018 in Italy. All the nests were detectable by thermal imaging,  but environmental and operative variables affect their detectability. The  temperature difference between the nests and the surrounding reaches its maximum  before sunrise and without a tree canopy covering the nests. Although nests were  visible in some cases from 30 m, the detectability was higher at shorter  distances, even if this variable may also depend on infrared camera resolution.  An increase in the environmental temperature also generates a decrease of nest  detectability. Although some limitations could occur, these results show the  applicability of thermography in detecting V. velutina nests before the beginning  of the reproductive phase, and consequently its potentiality in control  strategies.

AB  - Stakeholders are critical environmental managers in human-dominated landscapes. In some contexts, stakeholders can be forced to personally act following their  own observations and risk perception instead of science recommendation. In  particular, biological invasions need rapid control actions to reduce potential  socio-ecological impacts, while science-based risk assessments are rather complex  and time-delayed. Although they can lead to important detrimental effects on  biodiversity, potential time-delayed disconnections between stakeholders' action  and science recommendations are rarely studied. Using the case study of western  European beekeepers controlling the invasive Asian hornet Vespa velutina  nigrithorax for its suspected impact on honey bee colonies, we analysed  mechanisms underlying personal actions of stakeholders and how they evolved in  science disconnection. Personal actions of stakeholders were causal-effect linked  with their risk observation but disconnected to time-delayed science predictions  and recommendations. Unfortunately, these science-disconnected actions also led  to dramatic impacts on numerous species of the local entomofauna. These results  highlight the need to improve mutual risk communication between science and  action in the early-stages of management plans to improve the sustainably of  stakeholders' practices.

AB  - The Asian yellow-legged hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax, a major predator of honeybees, is spreading in Europe in part due to a lack of efficient control  methods. In this study, as a first step to identify biological control agents, we  characterized viral RNA sequences present in asymptomatic or symptomatic hornets.  Among 19 detected viruses, the honey bee virus Deformed wing virus-B was  predominant in all the samples, particularly in muscles from the symptomatic  hornet, suggesting a putative cause of the deformed wing symptom. Interestingly,  two new viruses closely related to Acyrthosiphon pisumvirus and Himetobi Pvirus  and viruses typically associated with honey bees, Acute bee paralysis virus and  Black queen cell virus, were detected in the brain and muscles, and may  correspond to the circulation and possible replication forms of these viruses in  the hornet. Aphid lethal paralysis virus, Bee Macula-like virus, and Moku virus,  which are known to infect honey bees, were also identified in the gut virus  metagenome of hornets. Therefore, our study underlined the urgent need to study  the host range of these newly discovered viruses in hornets to determine whether  they represent a new threat for honey bees or a hope for the biocontrol of V.  velutina.

AB  - Honey bees are essential to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. However, despite no single factor being blamed for losses of honey bee colonies in Europe  and the USA, viruses have been considered as a major driver. Moreover, a virus  vector can enhance the titer and virulence of virus such as Varroa destructor can  change the virulence of the deformed wing virus. Here, we report molecular  evidence for aphid lethal paralysis virus (ALPV) infecting Vespa velutina, which  is an important predator of honey bees, especially of Apis cerana. Viral  replication and phylogenetic analysis indicated that ALPV can not only replicate  in V. velutina and A. cerana, but ALPV from A. cerana (ALPV-Ac) was also  significantly associated with that of V. velutina (ALPV-Vv), though distinct from  those of Apis mellifera (ALPV-Am). The host state posterior probability displayed  that V. velutina is the main viral reservoir between V. velutina and A. cerana.  Our results show ALPV had expanded host diversity resulting in potential impacts  on the health of pollinators, even on the pollination ecosystem. We suggest  further studies should investigate potential risks and impacts on pollinator  populations of hornets. These results should have an impact conservation efforts  focused on sustaining native pollinator abundance and diversity, and therefore,  the crucial ecosystem services that they provide.

AB  - The yellow-legged hornet Vespa velutina has become one of the major alien species in European and East Asian countries. As in its homeland, the invading V.  velutina is reported as the major predator of honeybees and is becoming a threat  to beekeeping in Europe. However, it remains unknown how V. velutina might affect  native hornets when it invades Asia, where a large number of Vespa species are  distributed. Thus, by analyzing the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I  gene, we investigated whether interspecific mating occurs between V. velutina and  Japanese native Vespa spp. Our results showed that the alien V. velutina causes  reproductive interference in Japanese native hornet Vespa simillima. Forty-three  percent of native V. simillima queens had the sperm of V. velutina males, and  among the all V. simillima queens analyzed, 28% only had V. velutina sperm. We  did not find evidence of V. velutina queens having the sperm of V. simillima  males. These findings suggest that reproductive interference by V. velutina males  poses a threat to the native V. simillima populations. A decline of V. simillima  may also negatively affect other insects that interact with V. simillima.

End 2016, Moku virus was reported in Asian  hornets from the same area. In addition, the Moku virus was already present in  historical samples of bees collected in 2013, that is, 2 years after the official  first detection of Asian hornets in the same area of Belgium. This study suggests  a spread of Moku virus to honey bees with possible consequences.

AB  - In social insects, the activity rhythm of foragers and their action range determinate the activity of the colony. In vespids, which are mostly predators,  the foraging range of workers determines their maximum predation pressure round  the nest. One of these species, Vespa velutina, a recently invasive species  introduced into Europe, exerts a strong predation on honeybees at the hive.  Therefore, the definition of its activity rhythm and spatial range of predation  is of primary importance. Using radio frequency identification tags (RFID), two  experiments were carried out to (a) determine their return ability (called  homing) in releasing 318 individuals at different distance from their colony and  (b) monitor their foraging activity rhythm and the duration of their flights  based on 71 individuals followed 24 hr/24 during 2 months. The homing ability of  V. velutina was evaluated to be up to 5,000 m and was not affected by the  cardinal orientation of release point. The lag time to return to the nest  increased with the distance of release. Most of the flight activity took place  between 07:00 a.m. and 08:00 p.m., hornets doing principally short flights of  less than an hour. Foraging range was thus estimated ca. 1,000 m around the nest.  This study of V. velutina assisted by RFID tags provides for the first time a  baseline for its potential foraging distance that increase our knowledge of this  species to (a) refine more accurately models for risk assessment and (b) define  security perimeter for early detection of predation on invasion front.

AB  - The invasive yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax Lepeletier, 1836 (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), is native to Southeast Asia. It was first detected in  France (in the southwest) in 2005. It has since expanded throughout Europe and  has caused significant harm to honeybee populations. We must better characterize  the hornet's flight capacity to understand the species' success and develop  improved control strategies. Here, we carried out a study in which we quantified  the flight capacities of V. velutina workers using computerized flight mills. We  observed that workers were able to spend around 40% of the daily 7-hour flight  tests flying. On average, they flew 10km to 30km during each flight test,  although there was a large amount of variation. Workers sampled in early summer  had lower flight capacities than workers sampled later in the season. Flight  capacity decreased as workers aged. However, in the field, workers probably often  die before this decrease becomes significant. During each flight test, workers  performed several continuous flight phases of variable length that were separated  by rest phases. Based on the length of those continuous flight phases and certain  key assumptions, we estimated that V. velutina colony foraging radius is at least  700 m (half that in early summer); however, some workers are able to forage much  farther. While these laboratory findings remain to be confirmed by field studies,  our results can nonetheless help inform V. velutina biology and control efforts.

AB  - The yellow-legged or Asian hornet (Vespa velutina colour form nigrithorax) was introduced into France from China over a decade ago. Vespa velutina has since  spread rapidly across Europe, facilitated by suitable climatic conditions and the  ability of a single nest to disperse many mated queens over a large area.  Yellow-legged hornets are a major concern because of the potential impact they  have on populations of many beneficial pollinators, most notably the western  honey bee (Apis mellifera), which shows no effective defensive behaviours against  this exotic predator. Here, we present the first report of this species in Great  Britain. Actively foraging hornets were detected at two locations, the first  around a single nest in Gloucestershire, and the second a single hornet trapped  54 km away in Somerset. The foraging activity observed in Gloucestershire was  largely restricted to within 700 m of a single nest, suggesting highly localised  movements. Genetic analyses of individuals from the Gloucestershire nest and the  single hornet from Somerset suggest that these incursions represent an expansion  of the European population, rather than a second incursion from Asia. The  founding queen of the Gloucestershire nest mated with a single male, suggesting  that sexual reproduction may have occurred in an area of low nest density. Whilst  the nest contained diploid adult males, haploid 'true' males were only present at  the egg stage, indicating that the nest was detected and removed before the  production of queens. Members of the public reported additional dead hornets  associated with camping equipment recently returned from France and imported  timber products, highlighting possible pathways of incursion. The utility of  microsatellites to inform surveillance during an incursion and the challenge of  achieving eradication of this damaging pest are discussed.

AB  - Asian hornet, Vespa velutina Lepeletier nests were discovered in 2007 in Andernos-les-Bains on the south-west coast of France, 3 years after the first  reported sightings in France. The number of nests increased in the commune over  the following 7 years, despite local authorities enacting a destruction policy.  The nests existed in close proximity to one another leading to a high density of  over 10 nests per square kilometre in urban areas. New information on the chosen  habitat for nests is presented, and the differences between primary and secondary  locations are evident, with primary nests mostly occupying buildings and man-made  structures, while secondary nests were found on trees. Using Bayesian inference  methods, we fit a basic model to the observational data, which allows us to  estimate key demographic parameters. This model fit is highly informative for  predicting V. velutina spread and colonisation of other at-risk regions, and  suggests that local control has a limited impact on the spread of V. velutina  once established within a region.

AB  - Current approaches to risk assessment in bees do not take into account co-exposures from multiple stressors. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)  is deploying resources and efforts to move towards a holistic risk assessment  approach of multiple stressors in bees. This paper describes the general  principles of pesticide risk assessment in bees, including recent developments at  EFSA dealing with risk assessment of single and multiple pesticide residues and  biological hazards. The EFSA Guidance Document on the risk assessment of plant  protection products in bees highlights the need for the inclusion of an  uncertainty analysis, other routes of exposures and multiple stressors such as  chemical mixtures and biological agents. The EFSA risk assessment on the  survival, spread and establishment of the small hive beetle, Aethina tumida, an  invasive alien species, is provided with potential insights for other bee pests  such as the Asian hornet, Vespa velutina. Furthermore, data gaps are identified  at each step of the risk assessment, and recommendations are made for future  research that could be supported under the framework of Horizon 2020. Finally,  the recent work conducted at EFSA is presented, under the overarching MUST-B  project ("EU efforts towards the development of a holistic approach for the risk  assessment on MUltiple STressors in Bees") comprising a toolbox for harmonised  data collection under field conditions and a mechanistic model to assess effects  from pesticides and other stressors such as biological agents and beekeeping  management practices, at the colony level and in a spatially complex landscape.  Future perspectives at EFSA include the development of a data model to collate  high quality data to calibrate and validate the model to be used as a regulatory  tool. Finally, the evidence collected within the framework of MUST-B will support  EFSA's activities on the development of a holistic approach to the risk  assessment of multiple stressors in bees. In conclusion, EFSA calls for  collaborative action at the EU level to establish a common and open access  database to serve multiple purposes and different stakeholders.

AB  - The yellow-legged Asian hornet is an invasive species of wasps, indigenous to the Southeast Asia but recently spreading in Southern Europe. Because of its  exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honeybee colonies (and  to humans as well), restraint measures are currently under investigation. We  developed and tested an harmonic radar capable of tracking the flying trajectory  of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural  environment. Several hornets were captured close to a small cluster of honeybee  hives, tagged with different transponders and then released in order to follow  the flight toward their nest. On-field testing proved an initial maximum  detection range of about 125 m in a hilly and woody area. A number of detections  were clearly recorded, and preferential directions of flight were identified. The  system herein described is intended as a first low-cost harmonic radar; it proved  the capability to track the hornets while flying and it permitted to test the  tagging techniques. Several upgrades of the system have been identified during  this work and are extensively described in the last chapter. The designed system  has three major advantages over conventional harmonic radars. First and most  importantly, it adopts advanced processing techniques to suppress clutter and to  improve target detection. Second, it allows radar operations in complex  environments, generally hilly and rich in vegetation. Finally, it can  continuously track tagged insects (24/7) and in any meteorological condition,  providing an effective tool in order to locate the nests of the yellow-legged  Asian hornet.

AB  - Vespa velutina is an invasive species that was observed for the first time in France and Europe in 2004, which rapidly threatened domestic honeybees with  active predation. For the first time in this study, we analyzed the distribution  of V. velutina nests at a local scale to understand the pattern of nesting, and  in 8 years of monitoring, a total of 528 nests were surveyed. With the exception  of 2 years, the nests of V. velutina were randomly distributed within the  monitored area, which suggested that intraspecific competition for nesting sites  and/or food was unlikely. When the data for all years were combined, an  aggregated distribution of nests at the seafront in the vicinity of the oyster  farm and sportfishing activities was observed. This distribution suggested that  seafood, attractive to vespids, might provide a valuable alternative food source  that favored colony development. We also tested the effect of spring queen  trapping of V. velutina on the distribution of nests in 2014, which was the year  with the greatest number of colonies within the area; the position of the traps  did not influence the distribution of the nests. For the first time, this study  showed that (i) intraspecific competition was unlikely to be a mechanism for  population regulation, (ii) some areas were more likely favored for hornet nests,  and (iii) spring queen wasp trapping was inefficient as a method to limit the  distribution of the V. velutina population.

AB  - Since its introduction in France 10 years ago, the yellow-legged Asian bee-hawking hornet Vespa velutina has rapidly spread to neighboring countries  (Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, and Germany), becoming a new threat to  beekeeping activities. While introduced species often leave behind natural  enemies from their original home, which benefits them in their new environment,  they can also suffer local recruitment of natural enemies. Three mermithid  parasitic subadults were obtained from V. velutina adults in 2012, from two  French localities. However, these were the only parasitic nematodes reported up  to now in Europe, in spite of the huge numbers of nests destroyed each year and  the recent examination of 33,000 adult hornets. This suggests that the infection  of V. velutina by these nematodes is exceptional. Morphological criteria assigned  the specimens to the genus Pheromermis and molecular data (18S sequences) to the  Mermithidae, due to the lack of Pheromermis spp. sequences in GenBank. The  species is probably Pheromermis vesparum, a parasite of social wasps in Europe.  This nematode is the second native enemy of Vespa velutina recorded in France,  after a conopid fly whose larvae develop as internal parasitoids of adult wasps  and bumblebees. In this paper, we provide arguments for the local origin of the  nematode parasite and its limited impact on hornet colony survival. We also  clarify why these parasites (mermithids and conopids) most likely could not  hamper the hornet invasion nor be used in biological control programs against  this invasive species.

AB  - Since the beginning of the last century, the number of biological invasions has continuously increased worldwide. Due to their environmental and economical  consequences, invasive species are now a major concern. Social wasps are  particularly efficient invaders because of their distinctive biology and  behavior. Among them, the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, is a keen hunter  of domestic honeybees. Its recent introduction to Europe may induce important  beekeeping, pollination, and biodiversity problems. Hornets use olfactory cues  for the long-range detection of food sources, in this case the location of  honeybee colonies, but the exact nature of these cues remains unknown. Here, we  studied the orientation behavior of V. velutina workers towards a range of hive  products and protein sources, as well as towards prominent chemical substances  emitted by these food sources. In a multiple choice test performed under  controlled laboratory conditions, we found that hornets are strongly attracted to  the odor of some hive products, especially pollen and honey. When testing  specific compounds, the honeybee aggregation pheromone, geraniol, proved highly  attractive. Pheromones produced by honeybee larvae or by the queen were also of  interest to hornet workers, albeit to a lesser extent. Our results indicate that  V. velutina workers are selectively attracted towards olfactory cues from hives  (stored food, brood, and queen), which may signal a high prey density. This study  opens new perspectives for understanding hornets' hunting behavior and paves the  way for developing efficient trapping strategies against this invasive species.

AB  - We investigated the prey-predator interactions between the European honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the invasive yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, which  first invaded France in 2004 and thereafter spread to neighbouring European  countries (Spain, Portugal and Italy). Our goal was to determine how successfully  honeybees are able to defend their colonies against their new predator in Europe.  Experiments were conducted in the southwest of France-the point of entry of the  hornet in Europe-under natural and semi-controlled field conditions. We  investigated a total of eight apiaries and 95 colonies subjected to either low or  high levels of predation. We analyzed hornet predatory behaviour and collective  response of colonies under attack. The results showed that A. mellifera in France  exhibit an inefficient and unorganized defence against V. velutina, unlike in  other regions of Europe and other areas around the globe where honeybees have  co-evolved with their natural Vespa predators.

AB  - Since its recent introduction into Europe, the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, has become a major predator of the domestic honeybee, Apis mellifera,  but little is known about its hunting behavior. We studied V. velutina hunting  behavior by a capture-mark-recapture procedure in an experimental apiary. A total  of 360 hornets were captured and tagged, and we determined: (i) the number of  hornets visiting the apiary and the changes in time, (ii) the average number of  individual visits per half-day and the time elapsed between consecutive  recaptures, and (iii) the individual and global distribution of the hornets in  the apiary. More than 50% of the marked hornets were recaptured at least once,  this increased to 74% in considering the first marked individuals. We estimated  350 hornets visiting the patch daily with at least 1 visit per half-day. The  number of marked hornets decreased over time while the number of unmarked ones  increased, suggesting a turnover of individuals. The reduction of the delay  between consecutive visits indicates that hornets became more efficient over  time. Most of the hornets (88%) were recaptured in front of different hives but,  overall, the global distribution was aggregative. Hornets were mainly recaptured  in front of 1 hive which was neither the smallest nor the biggest colony,  suggesting that the major cue used by hornets is not the amount of food. We  hypothesize that the defensive behavior of the honeybee colony could explain our  results which may be promising to further studies.

AB  - Contrary to native predators, which have co-evolved with their prey, alien predators often benefit from native prey naïveté. Vespa velutina, a honeybee  predator originating from Eastern China, was introduced into France just before  2004. The present study, based on video recordings of two beehives at an early  stage of the invasion process, intends to analyse the alien hornet hunting  behaviour on the native prey, Apis mellifera, and to understand the interaction  between the activity of the predator and the prey during the day and the season.  Chasing hornets spent most of their time hovering facing the hive, to catch  flying honeybees returning to the hive. The predation pressure increased during  the season confirming previous study based on predator trapping. The number of  honeybee captures showed a maximum peak for an intermediate number of V.  velutina, unrelated to honeybee activity, suggesting the occurrence of  competition between hornets. The number of honeybees caught increased during  midday hours while the number of hornets did not vary, suggesting an increase in  their efficacy. These results suggest that the impact of V. velutina on honeybees  is limited by its own biology and behaviour and did not match the pattern of  activity of its prey. Also, it could have been advantageous during the invasion,  limiting resource depletion and thus favouring colonisation. This lack of  synchronization may also be beneficial for honeybee colonies by giving them an  opportunity to increase their activity when the hornets are less effective.

AB  - The vespine wasps, Vespa velutina, specialise in hawking honeybee foragers returning to their nests. We studied their behaviour in China using native Apis  cerana and introduced A. mellifera colonies. When the wasps are hawking, A.  cerana recruits threefold more guard bees to stave off predation than A.  mellifera. The former also utilises wing shimmering as a visual pattern  disruption mechanism, which is not shown by A. mellifera. A. cerana foragers  halve the time of normal flight needed to dart into the nest entrance, while A.  mellifera actually slows down in sashaying flight manoeuvres. V. velutina  preferentially hawks A. mellifera foragers when both A. mellifera and A. cerana  occur in the same apiary. The pace of wasp-hawking was highest in mid-summer but  the frequency of hawking wasps was three times higher at A. mellifera colonies  than at the A. cerana colonies. The wasps were taking A. mellifera foragers at a  frequency eightfold greater than A. cerana foragers. The final hawking success  rates of the wasps were about three times higher for A. mellifera foragers than  for A. cerana. The relative success of native A. cerana over European A.  mellifera in thwarting predation by the wasp V. velutina is interpreted as the  result of co-evolution between the Asian wasp and honeybee, respectively.

AB  - The total RNAs were isolated from the venom glands of female Polistes hebraeus, Vespula maculifrons, Vespa velutina nigrithorax and Vespa magnifica,  respectively. Using the ReverAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, the first cDNAs  were synthesized from the total RNA templates. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles  (40s at 94 degrees C, 40s at 52 degrees C and 1 min at 72 degrees C), with a  final extension of 10 min at 72 degrees C. RT-PCR products were examined by  electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels with ethidium bromide staining. After  purification using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, the PCR products were ligated  into pGEM*-T easy vector. Positive clones were identified by double digestion of  Xho I and Hind III and PCR amplification and then were sequenced. The sequencing  results showed that the amplified cDNAs containing the open reading frames of  prepromelittin, and their lengths were all 213 bp. The ORFs were potential to  encode polypeptides of 70 amino acid residues with predicted molecular weight of  7.7 kDa, including a signal peptide of 21 residues and a promelittin of 49  residues. Comparative analysis showed that the prepromelittins from different  wasp species shared more than 93% identities in nucleotide sequences and more  than 95% identities in amino acid sequences with each other, respectively. The  sequences of prepromelittins of Polistes hebraeus, Vespula maculifrons, Vespa  velutina nigrithorax and Vespa magnifica share 94%, 100%, 94%, 93% homologies in  nucleotide sequences, and 95.8%, 100%, 97.2% and 97.2% identities in amino acid  sequences with those of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, respectively.  There are 67 common amino acid residues among the prepromelittins of the four  wasps and two honey bee species, Apis mellifera and Apis cerana. Phylogenetic  relationships based on the prepromelitin nucleotide sequences were also examined  using the software DNAStar5.01. The result showed that a closer relationship lied  in between Polistes hebraeus, Vespa velutina nigrithorax and Vespa magnifica,  while Vespula maculifrons had a closer relationship with the honey bees, Apis  mellifera and Apis cerana. In conclusion, the prepromelittins were very conserved  in the primary structure and the wasp insects also contain the melittins in their  venoms, which are very similar to that of honey bee, although they belong to  different superfamilies.
