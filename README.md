## Project overview

Nearly a quarter century has passed since _Vespa velutina_ arrived by accident in Europe. And this **yellow-legged hornet** with its yellow legs is using her wings to spread over a large part of Europe. For the protein to raise the next generation, they don't make it difficult for themselves. In Europe domesticated bees (_Apis mellifera_) are widely available and easy to catch. So, let's find out what is published about the contribution of the **yellow-legged hornet** to the decline of Western **honeybee** populations.

%% `*yellow-legged hornet` is to prefer above `Asian hornet`, to avoid confusion with the the Asian `Vespa soror` that also arrived in Europe. %%
