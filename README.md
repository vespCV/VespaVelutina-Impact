# Impact of Vespa velutina on Apis mellifera in Europe

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Data extraction  
**Status:** Work in progress  

This repository contains exploratory research and preliminary analysis to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a systematic review or meta-analysis quantifying the impact of *Vespa velutina* (Asian hornet) on honeybees (*Apis mellifera*) in Europe.

## Project overview

Nearly a quarter century has passed since _Vespa velutina_ arrived by accident in Europe. And this Asian hornet with its yellow legs is using her wings to spread over a large part of Europe. Adult workers need protein-rich prey to feed the developing larvae in their nests, which they obtain primarily from insects. They don't make it difficult for themselves—in Europe domesticated bees (_Apis mellifera_) are widely available and easy to catch. So, let's find out what is published about the contribution of the **yellow-legged hornet** to the decline of Western **honeybee** populations.

**Primary Objective:**
- Quantify the impact of _Vespa velutina_ predation on managed _Apis mellifera_ colonies in Europe.

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Assess effects on bee health and beekeeping productivity, including:
  - Colony losses and survival
  - Reduced foraging activity
  - Honey yield reductions
  - Economic consequences for apiculture

## Rationale
Effective management strategies require evidence-based decisions. This requires a comprehensive understanding of the actual impact of _V. velutina_ on European honeybee populations and beekeeping operations. To date, the quantitative evidence base for predation impacts and associated economic consequences remains fragmented and has not been systematically synthesized. This exploratory work aims to assess whether sufficient evidence exists to conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis that may contribute to better-informed decisions about management policies, nest removal strategies, and beekeeping practices.
