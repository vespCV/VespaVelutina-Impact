# Impact of Vespa velutina on Apis mellifera in Europe

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Data extraction  
**Status:** Work in progress  

This repository contains exploratory research and preliminary analysis to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a systematic review or meta-analysis quantifying the impact of *Vespa velutina* (Asian hornet) on honeybees (*Apis mellifera*) in Europe.

## Project overview

Nearly a quarter century has passed since _Vespa velutina_ arrived by accident in Europe. And this Asian hornet* with its yellow legs is using her wings to spread over a large part of Europe. For the protein to raise the next generation, they don't make it difficult for themselves. In Europe domesticated bees (_Apis mellifera_) are widely available and easy to catch. So, let's find out what is published about the contribution of the **yellow-legged hornet** to the decline of Western **honeybee** populations.

**Primary Objective:**
- Quantify the impact of *Vespa velutina* predation on managed *Apis mellifera* colonies in Europe.

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Assess effects on bee health and beekeeping productivity, including:
  - Colony losses and survival
  - Reduced foraging activity
  - Honey yield reductions
  - Economic consequences for apiculture
