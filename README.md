# Impact of Vespa velutina on Apis mellifera in Europe

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Data extraction  
**Status:** Work in progress  

This repository contains exploratory research compiling available articles on the impact of *Vespa velutina* (Asian hornet) on honeybees (*Apis mellifera*) in Europe. The aim is to develop an online summary in a rolling list format (similar to InvaCost) that documents bee consumption and predation impacts, which can be continuously updated as new research becomes available.

## Project overview

Nearly a quarter century has passed since _Vespa velutina_ arrived by accident in Europe. And this Asian hornet with its yellow legs is using her wings to spread over a large part of Europe. Adult workers need protein-rich prey to feed the developing larvae in their nests, which they obtain primarily from insects. They don't make it difficult for themselves—in Europe domesticated bees (_Apis mellifera_) are widely available and easy to catch. So, let's find out what is published about the contribution of the **yellow-legged hornet** to the decline of Western **honeybee** populations.

**Primary Objective:**
- Quantify the impact of _Vespa velutina_ predation on managed _Apis mellifera_ colonies in Europe.

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Assess effects on bee health and beekeeping productivity, including:
  - Colony losses and survival
  - Reduced foraging activity
  - Honey yield reductions
  - Economic consequences for apiculture

## Rationale
Effective management strategies require evidence-based decisions. To date, the quantitative evidence base for predation impacts and associated economic consequences remains fragmented. This exploratory work aims to assess whether sufficient evidence exists to conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis that may contribute to better-informed decisions about management policies, nest removal strategies, and beekeeping practices.
