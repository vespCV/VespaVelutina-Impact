**Report Date**: 2025-11-08  
**Data Source**: `3_phase_II/_pdf_phase_II.csv`  
**Total Studies Included**: 30  
**Total Studies Excluded**: 4

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes quantitative data extracted from 30 peer-reviewed studies investigating the impact of the invasive Asian hornet (*Vespa velutina*) on European honeybees (*Apis mellifera*). The data synthesis reveals significant impacts on colony survival, foraging behavior, and economic costs to beekeeping operations.

## Key Findings

### 1. Predation Pressure

- **Predation success rates**: Range from 2.4% (video tracking) to 76.4% (inside hive balling)
- **Honeybee in diet**: 22-98% depending on detection method and location
- **Peak predation periods**: July-October (varies by geographic location)
- **Maximum hornets observed**: Up to 20+ simultaneously at single apiaries

### 2. Colony Survival

- **Survival rates with protection**: 55-78% (depending on method)
- **Survival rates without protection**: 35-56%
- **Risk threshold**: ≥5 hornets poses significant risk to colony survival
- **Colony collapse rates**: Up to 55.3% in high predation scenarios

### 3. Behavioral Impacts

- **Foraging paralysis threshold**: Complete paralysis at ≥12.6 hornets
- **Activity reductions**: Up to 65% reduction in foraging activity under high hornet pressure
- **Defensive behaviors**: Balling behavior observed in 72% of colonies, but only 9.5% effective outside hive

### 4. Economic Impact (France)

- **Low predation scenario**: €2.8 million/year (2.6% of livestock, 2.4% of honey revenues)
- **High predation scenario**: €30.8 million/year (29.2% of livestock, 26.6% of honey revenues)
- **Colony replacement cost**: €100 per colony
- **Control costs**: €11.9 million/year (damage costs up to 3× higher)

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths

- Comprehensive coverage of European invasion
- Multiple observation methods provide cross-validation
- Long-term studies (up to 5 years) available
- Economic impact quantified for France

### Limitations

- High methodological heterogeneity limits direct comparisons
- Most studies observational without explicit controls
- Small sample sizes in many studies (2-6 colonies)
- Geographic bias toward France and Spain
- Temporal variation in hornet population densities

## Recommendations

1. **For Beekeepers**:
   - Monitor hornet presence: ≥5 hornets indicates risk threshold
   - Implement protection measures (electric harps, muzzles) when hornet pressure is high
   - Expect 35-56% colony survival without protection in high-pressure areas

2. **For Policy Makers**:
   - Economic costs of damage (€2.8-30.8M/year in France) exceed control costs (€11.9M/year)
   - Systematic nest removal may be warranted given high economic impact
   - Support for beekeeper protection measures is economically justified

3. **For Researchers**:
   - Standardized protocols needed for future studies
   - Long-term monitoring programs recommended
   - Economic impact studies needed for other European countries
